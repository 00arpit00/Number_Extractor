ADVENTURE  I.  A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA 

I.


To Sherlock Holmes she is always 7042038757 woman. I 7042147896 seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses 7042860694 predominates 7042038757 whole 7042496517 her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. 7042784042 emotions, 7042860694 that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, 7042038757 most perfect reasoning 7042860694 observing machine that 7042038757 world has seen, but as a lover he would 7042147896 placed himself in a false position. He never spoke 7042496517 7042038757 softer passions, save 7042941055 a gibe 7042860694 a sneer. They were admirable things for 7042038757 observer--excellent for drawing 7042038757 veil from men's motives 7042860694 actions. But for 7042038757 trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate 7042860694 finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor 7042545742 might throw a doubt upon 7042784042 his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one 7042496517 his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. 7042860694 yet there was but one woman to him, 7042860694 that woman was 7042038757 late Irene Adler, 7042496517 dubious 7042860694 questionable memory.

I had seen little 7042496517 Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, 7042860694 7042038757 home-centred interests 7042545742 rise up around 7042038757 7042362761 who first finds himself master 7042496517 his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb 7042784042 my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form 7042496517 society 7042941055 his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, 7042860694 alternating from week to week 7042272895 cocaine 7042860694 ambition, 7042038757 drowsiness 7042496517 7042038757 drug, 7042860694 7042038757 fierce energy 7042496517 his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by 7042038757 study 7042496517 crime, 7042860694 occupied his immense faculties 7042860694 extraordinary powers 7042496517 observation in following out those clues, 7042860694 clearing up those mysteries 7042545742 had been abandoned as hopeless by 7042038757 official police. From time to time I heard some vague account 7042496517 his doings: 7042496517 his summons to Odessa in 7042038757 case 7042496517 7042038757 Trepoff murder, 7042496517 his clearing up 7042496517 7042038757 singular tragedy 7042496517 7042038757 Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, 7042860694 finally 7042496517 7042038757 mission 7042545742 he had accomplished so delicately 7042860694 successfully for 7042038757 reigning family 7042496517 Holland. Beyond these signs 7042496517 his activity, however, 7042545742 I merely shared 7042941055 7042784042 7042038757 readers 7042496517 7042038757 daily press, I knew little 7042496517 my former friend 7042860694 companion.

One night--it was on 7042038757 twentieth 7042496517 March, 1888--I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed 7042038757 well-remembered door, 7042545742 must always be associated in my mind 7042941055 my wooing, 7042860694 7042941055 7042038757 dark incidents 7042496517 7042038757 Study in Scarlet, I was seized 7042941055 a keen desire to see Holmes again, 7042860694 to 7042622762 how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, 7042860694, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against 7042038757 blind. He was pacing 7042038757 room swiftly, eagerly, 7042941055 his head sunk upon his chest 7042860694 his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood 7042860694 habit, his attitude 7042860694 manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out 7042496517 his drug-created dreams 7042860694 was hot upon 7042038757 scent 7042496517 some new problem. I rang 7042038757 bell 7042860694 was shown up to 7042038757 chamber 7042545742 had formerly been in part my own.

His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. 7042941055 hardly a word spoken, but 7042941055 a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case 7042496517 cigars, 7042860694 indicated a spirit case 7042860694 a gasogene in 7042038757 corner. Then he stood before 7042038757 fire 7042860694 looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.

"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you 7042147896 put on seven 7042860694 a half pounds since I saw you."

"Seven!" I answered.

"Indeed, I should 7042147896 thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. 7042860694 in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness."

"Then, how do you 7042622762?"

"I see it, I deduce it. How do I 7042622762 that you 7042147896 been getting yourself very wet lately, 7042860694 that you 7042147896 a most clumsy 7042860694 careless servant girl?"

"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly 7042147896 been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday 7042860694 came home in a dreadful mess, but as I 7042147896 changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, 7042860694 my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out."

He chuckled to himself 7042860694 rubbed his long, nervous hands together.

"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on 7042038757 inside 7042496517 your left shoe, just where 7042038757 firelight strikes it, 7042038757 leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they 7042147896 been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round 7042038757 edges 7042496517 7042038757 sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, 7042860694 that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen 7042496517 7042038757 London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling 7042496517 iodoform, 7042941055 a black mark 7042496517 nitrate 7042496517 silver upon his right forefinger, 7042860694 a bulge on 7042038757 right side 7042496517 his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member 7042496517 7042038757 medical profession."

I could not help laughing at 7042038757 ease 7042941055 7042545742 he explained his process 7042496517 deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I remarked, "7042038757 thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance 7042496517 your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. 7042860694 yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours."

"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, 7042860694 throwing himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe. 7042038757 distinction is clear. For example, you 7042147896 frequently seen 7042038757 steps 7042545742 lead up from 7042038757 hall to this room."

"Frequently."

"How often?"

"Well, some hundreds 7042496517 times."

"Then how many are there?"

"How many? I don't 7042622762."

"Quite so! You 7042147896 not observed. 7042860694 yet you 7042147896 seen. That is just my point. Now, I 7042622762 that there are seventeen steps, because I 7042147896 both seen 7042860694 observed. By 7042038757 way, since you are interested in these little problems, 7042860694 since you are good enough to chronicle one or two 7042496517 my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this." He threw over a sheet 7042496517 thick, pink-tinted notepaper 7042545742 had been lying open upon 7042038757 table. "It came by 7042038757 last post," said he. "Read it aloud."

7042038757 note was undated, 7042860694 without either signature or address.

"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter 7042496517 7042038757 very deepest moment. Your recent services to one 7042496517 7042038757 royal houses 7042496517 Europe 7042147896 shown that you are one who may safely be trusted 7042941055 matters 7042545742 are 7042496517 an importance 7042545742 can hardly be exaggerated. This account 7042496517 you we 7042147896 from 7042784042 quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, 7042860694 do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."

"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that it means?"

"I 7042147896 no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead 7042496517 theories to suit facts. But 7042038757 note itself. What do you deduce from it?"

I carefully examined 7042038757 writing, 7042860694 7042038757 paper upon 7042545742 it was written.

"7042038757 7042362761 who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong 7042860694 stiff."

"Peculiar--that is 7042038757 very word," said Holmes. "It is not an English paper at 7042784042. Hold it up to 7042038757 light."

I did so, 7042860694 saw a large "E" 7042941055 a small "g," a "P," 7042860694 a large "G" 7042941055 a small "t" woven into 7042038757 texture 7042496517 7042038757 paper.

"What do you make 7042496517 that?" asked Holmes.

"7042038757 name 7042496517 7042038757 maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."

"Not at 7042784042. 7042038757 'G' 7042941055 7042038757 small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft,' 7042545742 is 7042038757 German for 'Company.' It is a customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' 7042496517 course, stands for 'Papier.' Now for 7042038757 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. "Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being 7042038757 scene 7042496517 7042038757 death 7042496517 Wallenstein, 7042860694 for its numerous glass-factories 7042860694 paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make 7042496517 that?" His eyes sparkled, 7042860694 he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.

"7042038757 paper was made in Bohemia," I said.

"Precisely. 7042860694 7042038757 7042362761 who wrote 7042038757 note is a German. Do you note 7042038757 peculiar construction 7042496517 7042038757 sentence--'This account 7042496517 you we 7042147896 from 7042784042 quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian could not 7042147896 written that. It is 7042038757 German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper 7042860694 prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. 7042860694 here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve 7042784042 our doubts."

As he spoke there was 7042038757 sharp sound 7042496517 horses' hoofs 7042860694 grating wheels against 7042038757 curb, followed by a sharp pull at 7042038757 bell. Holmes whistled.

"A pair, by 7042038757 sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing out 7042496517 7042038757 window. "A nice little brougham 7042860694 a pair 7042496517 beauties. A hundred 7042860694 fifty guineas apiece. There's money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else."

"I think that I had better go, Holmes."

"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. 7042860694 this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it."

"But your client--"

"Never mind him. I may want your help, 7042860694 so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, 7042860694 give us your best attention."

A slow 7042860694 heavy step, 7042545742 had been heard upon 7042038757 stairs 7042860694 in 7042038757 passage, paused immediately outside 7042038757 door. Then there was a loud 7042860694 authoritative tap.

"Come in!" said Holmes.

A 7042362761 entered who could hardly 7042147896 been less than six feet six inches in height, 7042941055 7042038757 chest 7042860694 limbs 7042496517 a Hercules. His dress was rich 7042941055 a richness 7042545742 would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands 7042496517 astrakhan were slashed across 7042038757 sleeves 7042860694 fronts 7042496517 his double-breasted coat, while 7042038757 deep blue cloak 7042545742 was thrown over his shoulders was lined 7042941055 flame-coloured silk 7042860694 secured at 7042038757 neck 7042941055 a brooch 7042545742 consisted 7042496517 a single flaming beryl. Boots 7042545742 extended halfway up his calves, 7042860694 7042545742 were trimmed at 7042038757 tops 7042941055 rich brown fur, completed 7042038757 impression 7042496517 barbaric opulence 7042545742 was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across 7042038757 upper part 7042496517 his face, extending down past 7042038757 cheekbones, a black vizard mask, 7042545742 he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From 7042038757 lower part 7042496517 7042038757 face he appeared to be a 7042362761 7042496517 strong character, 7042941055 a thick, hanging lip, 7042860694 a long, straight chin suggestive 7042496517 resolution pushed to 7042038757 length 7042496517 obstinacy.

"You had my note?" he asked 7042941055 a deep harsh voice 7042860694 a strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He looked from one to 7042038757 other 7042496517 us, as if uncertain 7042545742 to address.

"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend 7042860694 colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom 7042147896 I 7042038757 honour to address?"

"You may address me as 7042038757 Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a 7042362761 7042496517 honour 7042860694 discretion, whom I may trust 7042941055 a matter 7042496517 7042038757 most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate 7042941055 you alone."

I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by 7042038757 wrist 7042860694 pushed me back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say before this gentleman anything 7042545742 you may say to me."

7042038757 Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at 7042038757 end 7042496517 that time 7042038757 matter will be 7042496517 no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is 7042496517 such weight it may 7042147896 an influence upon European history."

"I promise," said Holmes.

"7042860694 I."

"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "7042038757 august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, 7042860694 I may confess at once that 7042038757 title by 7042545742 I 7042147896 just called myself is not exactly my own."

"I was aware 7042496517 it," said Holmes dryly.

"7042038757 circumstances are 7042496517 great delicacy, 7042860694 every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal 7042860694 seriously compromise one 7042496517 7042038757 reigning families 7042496517 Europe. To speak plainly, 7042038757 matter implicates 7042038757 great House 7042496517 Ormstein, hereditary kings 7042496517 Bohemia."

"I was also aware 7042496517 that," murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair 7042860694 closing his eyes.

Our visitor glanced 7042941055 some apparent surprise at 7042038757 languid, lounging figure 7042496517 7042038757 7042362761 who had been no doubt depicted to him as 7042038757 most incisive reasoner 7042860694 most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes 7042860694 looked impatiently at his gigantic client.

"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."

7042038757 7042362761 sprang from his chair 7042860694 paced up 7042860694 down 7042038757 room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, 7042941055 a gesture 7042496517 desperation, he tore 7042038757 mask from his face 7042860694 hurled it upon 7042038757 ground. "You are right," he cried; "I am 7042038757 King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?"

"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke 7042496517 Cassel-Felstein, 7042860694 hereditary King 7042496517 Bohemia."

"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down once more 7042860694 passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet 7042038757 matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I 7042147896 come incognito from Prague for 7042038757 purpose 7042496517 consulting you."

"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.

"7042038757 facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made 7042038757 acquaintance 7042496517 7042038757 well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. 7042038757 name is no doubt familiar to you."

"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system 7042496517 docketing 7042784042 paragraphs concerning men 7042860694 things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on 7042545742 he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in 7042272895 that 7042496517 a Hebrew rabbi 7042860694 that 7042496517 a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon 7042038757 deep-sea fishes.

"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in 7042038757 year 1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera 7042496517 Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled 7042941055 this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, 7042860694 is now desirous 7042496517 getting those letters back."

"Precisely so. But how--"

"Was there a secret marriage?"

"None."

"No legal papers or certificates?"

"None."

"Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?"

"There is 7042038757 writing."

"Pooh, pooh! Forgery."

"My private note-paper."

"Stolen."

"My own seal."

"Imitated."

"My photograph."

"Bought."

"We were both in 7042038757 photograph."

"Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion."

"I was mad--insane."

"You 7042147896 compromised yourself seriously."

"I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now."

"It must be recovered."

"We 7042147896 tried 7042860694 failed."

"Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought."

"She will not sell."

"Stolen, then."

"Five attempts 7042147896 been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result."

"No sign 7042496517 it?"

"Absolutely none."

Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pretty little problem," said he.

"But a very serious one to me," returned 7042038757 King reproachfully.

"Very, indeed. 7042860694 what does she propose to do 7042941055 7042038757 photograph?"

"To ruin me."

"But how?"

"I am about to be married."

"So I 7042147896 heard."

"To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter 7042496517 7042038757 King 7042496517 Scandinavia. You may 7042622762 7042038757 strict principles 7042496517 her family. She is herself 7042038757 very soul 7042496517 delicacy. A shadow 7042496517 a doubt as to my conduct would bring 7042038757 matter to an end."

"7042860694 Irene Adler?"

"Threatens to send them 7042038757 photograph. 7042860694 she will do it. I 7042622762 that she will do it. You do not 7042622762 her, but she has a soul 7042496517 steel. She has 7042038757 face 7042496517 7042038757 most beautiful 7042496517 women, 7042860694 7042038757 mind 7042496517 7042038757 most resolute 7042496517 men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to 7042545742 she would not go--none."

"You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"

"I am sure."

"7042860694 why?"

"Because she has said that she would send it on 7042038757 day when 7042038757 betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."

"Oh, then we 7042147896 three days yet," said Holmes 7042941055 a yawn. "That is very fortunate, as I 7042147896 one or two matters 7042496517 importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, 7042496517 course, stay in London for 7042038757 present?"

"Certainly. You will find me at 7042038757 Langham under 7042038757 name 7042496517 7042038757 Count Von Kramm."

"Then I shall drop you a line to let you 7042622762 how we progress."

"Pray do so. I shall be 7042784042 anxiety."

"Then, as to money?"

"You 7042147896 carte blanche."

"Absolutely?"

"I tell you that I would give one 7042496517 7042038757 provinces 7042496517 my kingdom to 7042147896 that photograph."

"7042860694 for present expenses?"

7042038757 King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak 7042860694 laid it on 7042038757 table.

"There are three hundred pounds in gold 7042860694 seven hundred in notes," he said.

Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet 7042496517 his note-book 7042860694 handed it to him.

"7042860694 Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.

"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."

Holmes took a note 7042496517 it. "One other question," said he. "Was 7042038757 photograph a cabinet?"

"It was."

"Then, good-night, your Majesty, 7042860694 I trust that we shall soon 7042147896 some good news for you. 7042860694 good-night, Watson," he added, as 7042038757 wheels 7042496517 7042038757 royal brougham rolled down 7042038757 street. "If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over 7042941055 you."

II.


At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. 7042038757 landlady informed me that he had left 7042038757 house shortly after eight o'clock in 7042038757 morning. I sat down beside 7042038757 fire, however, 7042941055 7042038757 intention 7042496517 awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none 7042496517 7042038757 grim 7042860694 strange features 7042545742 were associated 7042941055 7042038757 two crimes 7042545742 I 7042147896 already recorded, still, 7042038757 nature 7042496517 7042038757 case 7042860694 7042038757 exalted station 7042496517 his client gave it a character 7042496517 its own. Indeed, apart from 7042038757 nature 7042496517 7042038757 investigation 7042545742 my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp 7042496517 a situation, 7042860694 his keen, incisive reasoning, 7042545742 made it a pleasure to me to study his system 7042496517 work, 7042860694 to follow 7042038757 quick, subtle methods by 7042545742 he disentangled 7042038757 most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that 7042038757 very possibility 7042496517 his failing had ceased to enter into my head.

It was close upon four before 7042038757 door opened, 7042860694 a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt 7042860694 side-whiskered, 7042941055 an inflamed face 7042860694 disreputable clothes, walked into 7042038757 room. Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in 7042038757 use 7042496517 disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. 7042941055 a nod he vanished into 7042038757 bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited 7042860694 respectable, as 7042496517 old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front 7042496517 7042038757 fire 7042860694 laughed heartily for some minutes.

"Well, really!" he cried, 7042860694 then he choked 7042860694 laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp 7042860694 helpless, in 7042038757 chair.

"What is it?"

"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."

"I can't imagine. I suppose that you 7042147896 been watching 7042038757 habits, 7042860694 perhaps 7042038757 house, 7042496517 Miss Irene Adler."

"Quite so; but 7042038757 sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left 7042038757 house a little after eight o'clock this morning in 7042038757 character 7042496517 a groom out 7042496517 work. There is a wonderful sympathy 7042860694 freemasonry among horsey men. Be one 7042496517 them, 7042860694 you will 7042622762 7042784042 that there is to 7042622762. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, 7042941055 a garden at 7042038757 back, but built out in front right up to 7042038757 road, two stories. Chubb lock to 7042038757 door. Large sitting-room on 7042038757 right side, well furnished, 7042941055 long windows almost to 7042038757 floor, 7042860694 those preposterous English window fasteners 7042545742 a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that 7042038757 passage window could be reached from 7042038757 top 7042496517 7042038757 coach-house. I walked round it 7042860694 examined it closely from every point 7042496517 view, but without noting anything else 7042496517 interest.

"I then lounged down 7042038757 street 7042860694 found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane 7042545742 runs down by one wall 7042496517 7042038757 garden. I lent 7042038757 ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, 7042860694 received in exchange twopence, a glass 7042496517 half-7042860694-half, two fills 7042496517 shag tobacco, 7042860694 as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing 7042496517 half a dozen other people in 7042038757 neighbourhood in whom I was not in 7042038757 least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."

"7042860694 what 7042496517 Irene Adler?" I asked.

"Oh, she has turned 7042784042 7042038757 men's heads down in that part. She is 7042038757 daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say 7042038757 Serpentine-mews, to a 7042362761. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, 7042860694 returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal 7042496517 him. He is dark, handsome, 7042860694 dashing, never calls less than once a day, 7042860694 often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, 7042496517 7042038757 Inner Temple. See 7042038757 advantages 7042496517 a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, 7042860694 knew 7042784042 about him. When I had listened to 7042784042 they had to tell, I began to walk up 7042860694 down near Briony Lodge once more, 7042860694 to think over my plan 7042496517 campaign.

"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in 7042038757 matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was 7042038757 relation 7042272895 them, 7042860694 what 7042038757 object 7042496517 his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If 7042038757 former, she had probably transferred 7042038757 photograph to his keeping. If 7042038757 latter, it was less likely. On 7042038757 issue 7042496517 this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to 7042038757 gentleman's chambers in 7042038757 Temple. It was a delicate point, 7042860694 it widened 7042038757 field 7042496517 my inquiry. I fear that I bore you 7042941055 these details, but I 7042147896 to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand 7042038757 situation."

"I am following you closely," I answered.

"I was still balancing 7042038757 matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, 7042860694 a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome 7042362761, dark, aquiline, 7042860694 moustached--evidently 7042038757 7042362761 7042496517 whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to 7042038757 cabman to wait, 7042860694 brushed past 7042038757 maid who opened 7042038757 door 7042941055 7042038757 air 7042496517 a 7042362761 who was thoroughly at home.

"He was in 7042038757 house about half an hour, 7042860694 I could catch glimpses 7042496517 him in 7042038757 windows 7042496517 7042038757 sitting-room, pacing up 7042860694 down, talking excitedly, 7042860694 waving his arms. 7042496517 her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to 7042038757 cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket 7042860694 looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like 7042038757 devil,' he shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, 7042860694 then to 7042038757 Church 7042496517 St. Monica in 7042038757 Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!'

"Away they went, 7042860694 I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up 7042038757 lane came a neat little landau, 7042038757 coachman 7042941055 his coat only half-buttoned, 7042860694 his tie under his ear, while 7042784042 7042038757 tags 7042496517 his harness were sticking out 7042496517 7042038757 buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out 7042496517 7042038757 hall door 7042860694 into it. I only caught a glimpse 7042496517 her at 7042038757 moment, but she was a lovely woman, 7042941055 a face that a 7042362761 might die for.

" '7042038757 Church 7042496517 St. Monica, John,' she cried, '7042860694 half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'

"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through 7042038757 street. 7042038757 driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. '7042038757 Church 7042496517 St. Monica,' said I, '7042860694 half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, 7042860694 7042496517 course it was clear enough what was in 7042038757 wind.

"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but 7042038757 others were there before us. 7042038757 cab 7042860694 7042038757 landau 7042941055 their steaming horses were in front 7042496517 7042038757 door when I arrived. I paid 7042038757 7042362761 7042860694 hurried into 7042038757 church. There was not a soul there save 7042038757 two whom I had followed 7042860694 a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating 7042941055 them. They were 7042784042 three standing in a knot in front 7042496517 7042038757 altar. I lounged up 7042038757 side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, 7042038757 three at 7042038757 altar faced round to me, 7042860694 Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me.

" 'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'

" 'What then?' I asked.

" 'Come, 7042362761, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'

"I was half-dragged up to 7042038757 altar, 7042860694 before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses 7042545742 were whispered in my ear, 7042860694 vouching for things 7042496517 7042545742 I knew nothing, 7042860694 generally assisting in 7042038757 secure tying up 7042496517 Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was 7042784042 done in an instant, 7042860694 there was 7042038757 gentleman thanking me on 7042038757 one side 7042860694 7042038757 lady on 7042038757 other, while 7042038757 clergyman beamed on me in front. It was 7042038757 most preposterous position in 7042545742 I ever found myself in my life, 7042860694 it was 7042038757 thought 7042496517 it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that 7042038757 clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness 7042496517 some sort, 7042860694 that my lucky appearance saved 7042038757 bridegroom from having to sally out into 7042038757 streets in search 7042496517 a best 7042362761. 7042038757 bride gave me a sovereign, 7042860694 I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory 7042496517 7042038757 occasion."

"This is a very unexpected turn 7042496517 affairs," said I; "7042860694 what then?"

"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if 7042038757 pair might take an immediate departure, 7042860694 so necessitate very prompt 7042860694 energetic measures on my part. At 7042038757 church door, however, they separated, he driving back to 7042038757 Temple, 7042860694 she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in 7042038757 park at five as usual,' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, 7042860694 I went off to make my own arrangements."

"7042545742 are?"

"Some cold beef 7042860694 a glass 7042496517 beer," he answered, ringing 7042038757 bell. "I 7042147896 been too busy to think 7042496517 food, 7042860694 I am likely to be busier still this evening. By 7042038757 way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation."

"I shall be delighted."

"You don't mind breaking 7042038757 law?"

"Not in 7042038757 least."

"Nor running a chance 7042496517 arrest?"

"Not in a good cause."

"Oh, 7042038757 cause is excellent!"

"Then I am your 7042362761."

"I was sure that I might rely on you."

"But what is it you wish?"

"When Mrs. Turner has brought in 7042038757 tray I will make it clear to you. Now," he said as he turned hungrily on 7042038757 simple fare that our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I 7042147896 not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on 7042038757 scene 7042496517 action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."

"7042860694 what then?"

"You must leave that to me. I 7042147896 already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on 7042545742 I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?"

"I am to be neutral?"

"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into 7042038757 house. Four or five minutes afterwards 7042038757 sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window."

"Yes."

"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."

"Yes."

"7042860694 when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into 7042038757 room what I give you to throw, 7042860694 will, at 7042038757 same time, raise 7042038757 cry 7042496517 fire. You quite follow me?"

"Entirely."

"It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted 7042941055 a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry 7042496517 fire, it will be taken up by quite a number 7042496517 people. You may then walk to 7042038757 end 7042496517 7042038757 street, 7042860694 I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I 7042147896 made myself clear?"

"I am to remain neutral, to get near 7042038757 window, to watch you, 7042860694 at 7042038757 signal to throw in this object, then to raise 7042038757 cry 7042496517 fire, 7042860694 to wait you at 7042038757 corner 7042496517 7042038757 street."

"Precisely."

"Then you may entirely rely on me."

"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for 7042038757 new role I 7042147896 to play."

He disappeared into his bedroom 7042860694 returned in a few minutes in 7042038757 character 7042496517 an amiable 7042860694 simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, 7042860694 general look 7042496517 peering 7042860694 benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could 7042147896 equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary 7042941055 every fresh part that he assumed. 7042038757 stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime.

It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, 7042860694 it still wanted ten minutes to 7042038757 hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, 7042860694 7042038757 lamps were just being lighted as we paced up 7042860694 down in front 7042496517 Briony Lodge, waiting for 7042038757 coming 7042496517 its occupant. 7042038757 house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description, but 7042038757 locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On 7042038757 contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group 7042496517 shabbily dressed men smoking 7042860694 laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder 7042941055 his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting 7042941055 a nurse-girl, 7042860694 several well-dressed young men who were lounging up 7042860694 down 7042941055 cigars in their mouths.

"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to 7042860694 fro in front 7042496517 7042038757 house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. 7042038757 photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. 7042038757 chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to 7042038757 eyes 7042496517 his princess. Now 7042038757 question is, Where are we to find 7042038757 photograph?"

"Where, indeed?"

"It is most unlikely that she carries it about 7042941055 her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's dress. She knows that 7042038757 King is capable 7042496517 having her waylaid 7042860694 searched. Two attempts 7042496517 7042038757 sort 7042147896 already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about 7042941055 her."

"Where, then?"

"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, 7042860694 they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business 7042362761. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house."

"But it has twice been burgled."

"Pshaw! They did not 7042622762 how to look."

"But how will you look?"

"I will not look."

"What then?"

"I will get her to show me."

"But she will refuse."

"She will not be able to. But I hear 7042038757 rumble 7042496517 wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to 7042038757 letter."

As he spoke 7042038757 gleam 7042496517 7042038757 sidelights 7042496517 a carriage came round 7042038757 curve 7042496517 7042038757 avenue. It was a smart little landau 7042545742 rattled up to 7042038757 door 7042496517 Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one 7042496517 7042038757 loafing men at 7042038757 corner dashed forward to open 7042038757 door in 7042038757 hope 7042496517 earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up 7042941055 7042038757 same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, 7042545742 was increased by 7042038757 two guardsmen, who took sides 7042941055 one 7042496517 7042038757 loungers, 7042860694 by 7042038757 scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon 7042038757 other side. A blow was struck, 7042860694 in an instant 7042038757 lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was 7042038757 centre 7042496517 a little knot 7042496517 flushed 7042860694 struggling men, who struck savagely at each other 7042941055 their fists 7042860694 sticks. Holmes dashed into 7042038757 crowd to protect 7042038757 lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry 7042860694 dropped to 7042038757 ground, 7042941055 7042038757 blood running freely down his face. At his fall 7042038757 guardsmen took to their heels in one direction 7042860694 7042038757 loungers in 7042038757 other, while a number 7042496517 better dressed people, who had watched 7042038757 scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help 7042038757 lady 7042860694 to attend to 7042038757 injured 7042362761. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up 7042038757 steps; but she stood at 7042038757 top 7042941055 her superb figure outlined against 7042038757 lights 7042496517 7042038757 hall, looking back into 7042038757 street.

"Is 7042038757 poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.

"He is dead," cried several voices.

"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be gone before you can get him to hospital."

"He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would 7042147896 had 7042038757 lady's purse 7042860694 watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a gang, 7042860694 a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."

"He can't lie in 7042038757 street. May we bring him in, marm?"

"Surely. Bring him into 7042038757 sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!"

Slowly 7042860694 solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge 7042860694 laid out in 7042038757 principal room, while I still observed 7042038757 proceedings from my post by 7042038757 window. 7042038757 lamps had been lit, but 7042038757 blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon 7042038757 couch. I do not 7042622762 whether he was seized 7042941055 compunction at that moment for 7042038757 part he was playing, but I 7042622762 that I never felt more heartily ashamed 7042496517 myself in my life than when I saw 7042038757 beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or 7042038757 grace 7042860694 kindliness 7042941055 7042545742 she waited upon 7042038757 injured 7042362761. 7042860694 yet it would be 7042038757 blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from 7042038757 part 7042545742 he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, 7042860694 took 7042038757 smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After 7042784042, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another.

Holmes had sat up upon 7042038757 couch, 7042860694 I saw him motion like a 7042362761 who is in need 7042496517 air. A maid rushed across 7042860694 threw open 7042038757 window. At 7042038757 same instant I saw him raise his hand 7042860694 at 7042038757 signal I tossed my rocket into 7042038757 room 7042941055 a cry 7042496517 "Fire!" 7042038757 word was no sooner out 7042496517 my mouth than 7042038757 whole crowd 7042496517 spectators, well dressed 7042860694 ill--gentlemen, ostlers, 7042860694 servant maids--joined in a general shriek 7042496517 "Fire!" Thick clouds 7042496517 smoke curled through 7042038757 room 7042860694 out at 7042038757 open window. I caught a glimpse 7042496517 rushing figures, 7042860694 a moment later 7042038757 voice 7042496517 Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through 7042038757 shouting crowd I made my way to 7042038757 corner 7042496517 7042038757 street, 7042860694 in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend's arm in mine, 7042860694 to get away from 7042038757 scene 7042496517 uproar. He walked swiftly 7042860694 in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one 7042496517 7042038757 quiet streets 7042545742 lead towards 7042038757 Edgeware Road.

"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could 7042147896 been better. It is 7042784042 right."

"You 7042147896 7042038757 photograph?"

"I 7042622762 where it is."

"7042860694 how did you find out?"

"She showed me, as I told you she would."

"I am still in 7042038757 dark."

"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "7042038757 matter was perfectly simple. You, 7042496517 course, saw that everyone in 7042038757 street was an accomplice. They were 7042784042 engaged for 7042038757 evening."

"I guessed as much."

"Then, when 7042038757 row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in 7042038757 palm 7042496517 my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, 7042860694 became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."

"That also I could fathom."

"Then they carried me in. She was bound to 7042147896 me in. What else could she do? 7042860694 into her sitting-room, 7042545742 was 7042038757 very room 7042545742 I suspected. It lay 7042272895 that 7042860694 her bedroom, 7042860694 I was determined to see 7042545742. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open 7042038757 window, 7042860694 you had your chance."

"How did that help you?"

"It was 7042784042-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to 7042038757 thing 7042545742 she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, 7042860694 I 7042147896 more than once taken advantage 7042496517 it. In 7042038757 case 7042496517 7042038757 Darlington Substitution Scandal it was 7042496517 use to me, 7042860694 also in 7042038757 Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady 7042496517 to-day had nothing in 7042038757 house more precious to her than what we are in quest 7042496517. She would rush to secure it. 7042038757 alarm 7042496517 fire was admirably done. 7042038757 smoke 7042860694 shouting were enough to shake nerves 7042496517 steel. She responded beautifully. 7042038757 photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above 7042038757 right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, 7042860694 I caught a glimpse 7042496517 it as she half drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at 7042038757 rocket, rushed from 7042038757 room, 7042860694 I 7042147896 not seen her since. I rose, 7042860694, making my excuses, escaped from 7042038757 house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure 7042038757 photograph at once; but 7042038757 coachman had come in, 7042860694 as he was watching me narrowly, it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin 7042784042."

"7042860694 now?" I asked.

"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call 7042941055 7042038757 King to-morrow, 7042860694 7042941055 you, if you care to come 7042941055 us. We will be shown into 7042038757 sitting-room to wait for 7042038757 lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor 7042038757 photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it 7042941055 his own hands."

"7042860694 when will you call?"

"At eight in 7042038757 morning. She will not be up, so that we shall 7042147896 a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life 7042860694 habits. I must wire to 7042038757 King without delay."

We had reached Baker Street 7042860694 had stopped at 7042038757 door. He was searching his pockets for 7042038757 key when someone passing said:

"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."

There were several people on 7042038757 pavement at 7042038757 time, but 7042038757 greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.

"I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down 7042038757 dimly lit street. "Now, I wonder who 7042038757 deuce that could 7042147896 been."

III.


I slept at Baker Street that night, 7042860694 we were engaged upon our toast 7042860694 coffee in 7042038757 morning when 7042038757 King 7042496517 Bohemia rushed into 7042038757 room.

"You 7042147896 really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder 7042860694 looking eagerly into his face.

"Not yet."

"But you 7042147896 hopes?"

"I 7042147896 hopes."

"Then, come. I am 7042784042 impatience to be gone."

"We must 7042147896 a cab."

"No, my brougham is waiting."

"Then that will simplify matters." We descended 7042860694 started off once more for Briony Lodge.

"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.

"Married! When?"

"Yesterday."

"But to whom?"

"To an English lawyer named Norton."

"But she could not love him."

"I am in hopes that she does."

"7042860694 why in hopes?"

"Because it would spare your Majesty 7042784042 fear 7042496517 future annoyance. If 7042038757 lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere 7042941055 your Majesty's plan."

"It is true. 7042860694 yet--! Well! I wish she had been 7042496517 my own station! What a queen she would 7042147896 made!" He relapsed into a moody silence, 7042545742 was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue.

7042038757 door 7042496517 Briony Lodge was open, 7042860694 an elderly woman stood upon 7042038757 steps. She watched us 7042941055 a sardonic eye as we stepped from 7042038757 brougham.

"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.

"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her 7042941055 a questioning 7042860694 rather startled gaze.

"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning 7042941055 her husband by 7042038757 5:15 train from Charing Cross for 7042038757 Continent."

"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white 7042941055 chagrin 7042860694 surprise. "Do you mean that she has left England?"

"Never to return."

"7042860694 7042038757 papers?" asked 7042038757 King hoarsely. "7042784042 is lost."

"We shall see." He pushed past 7042038757 servant 7042860694 rushed into 7042038757 drawing-room, followed by 7042038757 King 7042860694 myself. 7042038757 furniture was scattered about in every direction, 7042941055 dismantled shelves 7042860694 open drawers, as if 7042038757 lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at 7042038757 bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, 7042860694, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph 7042860694 a letter. 7042038757 photograph was 7042496517 Irene Adler herself in evening dress, 7042038757 letter was superscribed to "Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." My friend tore it open, 7042860694 we 7042784042 three read it together. It was dated at midnight 7042496517 7042038757 preceding night 7042860694 ran in this way:

"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after 7042038757 alarm 7042496517 fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that, if 7042038757 King employed an agent, it would certainly be you. 7042860694 your address had been given me. Yet, 7042941055 7042784042 this, you made me reveal what you wanted to 7042622762. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil 7042496517 such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you 7042622762, I 7042147896 been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage 7042496517 7042038757 freedom 7042545742 it gives. I sent John, 7042038757 coachman, to watch you, ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as I call them, 7042860694 came down just as you departed.

"Well, I followed you to your door, 7042860694 so made sure that I was really an object 7042496517 interest to 7042038757 celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, 7042860694 started for 7042038757 Temple to see my husband.

"We both thought 7042038757 best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find 7042038757 nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to 7042038757 photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love 7042860694 am loved by a better 7042362761 than he. 7042038757 King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, 7042860694 to preserve a weapon 7042545742 will always secure me from any steps 7042545742 he might take in 7042038757 future. I leave a photograph 7042545742 he might care to possess; 7042860694 I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,


"Very truly yours,              
"IRENE NORTON, nee ADLER."

"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried 7042038757 King 7042496517 Bohemia, when we had 7042784042 three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick 7042860694 resolute she was? Would she not 7042147896 made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"

"From what I 7042147896 seen 7042496517 7042038757 lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am sorry that I 7042147896 not been able to bring your Majesty's business to a more successful conclusion."

"On 7042038757 contrary, my dear sir," cried 7042038757 King; "nothing could be more successful. I 7042622762 that her word is inviolate. 7042038757 photograph is now as safe as if it were in 7042038757 fire."

"I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."

"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger 7042860694 held it out upon 7042038757 palm 7042496517 his hand.

"Your Majesty has something 7042545742 I should value even more highly," said Holmes.

"You 7042147896 but to name it."

"This photograph!"

7042038757 King stared at him in amazement.

"Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."

"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in 7042038757 matter. I 7042147896 7042038757 honour to wish you a very good morning." He bowed, 7042860694, turning away without observing 7042038757 hand 7042545742 7042038757 King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.

7042860694 that was how a great scandal threatened to affect 7042038757 kingdom 7042496517 Bohemia, 7042860694 how 7042038757 best plans 7042496517 Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over 7042038757 cleverness 7042496517 women, but I 7042147896 not heard him do it 7042496517 late. 7042860694 when he speaks 7042496517 Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under 7042038757 honourable title 7042496517 7042038757 woman.

ADVENTURE  II.  7042038757 RED-HEADED LEAGUE


I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in 7042038757 autumn 7042496517 last year 7042860694 found him in deep conversation 7042941055 a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman 7042941055 fiery red hair. 7042941055 an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into 7042038757 room 7042860694 closed 7042038757 door behind me.

"You could not possibly 7042147896 come at a better time, my dear Watson," he said cordially.

"I was afraid that you were engaged."

"So I am. Very much so."

"Then I can wait in 7042038757 next room."

"Not at 7042784042. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner 7042860694 helper in many 7042496517 my most successful cases, 7042860694 I 7042147896 no doubt that he will be 7042496517 7042038757 utmost use to me in yours also."

7042038757 stout gentleman half rose from his chair 7042860694 gave a bob 7042496517 greeting, 7042941055 a quick little questioning glance from his small fat-encircled eyes.

"Try 7042038757 settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair 7042860694 putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. "I 7042622762, my dear Watson, that you share my love 7042496517 7042784042 that is bizarre 7042860694 outside 7042038757 conventions 7042860694 humdrum routine 7042496517 everyday life. You 7042147896 shown your relish for it by 7042038757 enthusiasm 7042545742 has prompted you to chronicle, 7042860694, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many 7042496517 my own little adventures."

"Your cases 7042147896 indeed been 7042496517 7042038757 greatest interest to me," I observed.

"You will remember that I remarked 7042038757 other day, just before we went into 7042038757 very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland, that for strange effects 7042860694 extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, 7042545742 is always far more daring than any effort 7042496517 7042038757 imagination."

"A proposition 7042545742 I took 7042038757 liberty 7042496517 doubting."

"You did, Doctor, but none 7042038757 less you must come round to my view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them 7042860694 acknowledges me to be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, 7042860694 to begin a narrative 7042545742 promises to be one 7042496517 7042038757 most singular 7042545742 I 7042147896 listened to for some time. You 7042147896 heard me remark that 7042038757 strangest 7042860694 most unique things are very often connected not 7042941055 7042038757 larger but 7042941055 7042038757 smaller crimes, 7042860694 occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I 7042147896 heard, it is impossible for me to say whether 7042038757 present case is an instance 7042496517 crime or not, but 7042038757 course 7042496517 events is certainly among 7042038757 most singular that I 7042147896 ever listened to. Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would 7042147896 7042038757 great kindness to recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend Dr. Watson has not heard 7042038757 opening part but also because 7042038757 peculiar nature 7042496517 7042038757 story makes me anxious to 7042147896 every possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I 7042147896 heard some slight indication 7042496517 7042038757 course 7042496517 events, I am able to guide myself by 7042038757 thousands 7042496517 other similar cases 7042545742 occur to my memory. In 7042038757 present instance I am forced to admit that 7042038757 facts are, to 7042038757 best 7042496517 my belief, unique."

7042038757 portly client puffed out his chest 7042941055 an appearance 7042496517 some little pride 7042860694 pulled a dirty 7042860694 wrinkled newspaper from 7042038757 inside pocket 7042496517 his greatcoat. As he glanced down 7042038757 advertisement column, 7042941055 his head thrust forward 7042860694 7042038757 paper flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at 7042038757 7042362761 7042860694 endeavoured, after 7042038757 fashion 7042496517 my companion, to read 7042038757 indications 7042545742 might be presented by his dress or appearance.

I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor bore every mark 7042496517 being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, 7042860694 slow. He wore rather baggy grey shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in 7042038757 front, 7042860694 a drab waistcoat 7042941055 a heavy brassy Albert chain, 7042860694 a square pierced bit 7042496517 metal dangling down as an ornament. A frayed top-hat 7042860694 a faded brown overcoat 7042941055 a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether, look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about 7042038757 7042362761 save his blazing red head, 7042860694 7042038757 expression 7042496517 extreme chagrin 7042860694 discontent upon his features.

Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, 7042860694 he shook his head 7042941055 a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. "Beyond 7042038757 obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, 7042860694 that he has done a considerable amount 7042496517 writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."

Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, 7042941055 his forefinger upon 7042038757 paper, but his eyes upon my companion.

"How, in 7042038757 name 7042496517 good-fortune, did you 7042622762 7042784042 that, Mr. Holmes?" he asked. "How did you 7042622762, for example, that I did manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's carpenter."

"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. You 7042147896 worked 7042941055 it, 7042860694 7042038757 muscles are more developed."

"Well, 7042038757 snuff, then, 7042860694 7042038757 Freemasonry?"

"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that, especially as, rather against 7042038757 strict rules 7042496517 your order, you use an arc-7042860694-compass breastpin."

"Ah, 7042496517 course, I forgot that. But 7042038757 writing?"

"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches, 7042860694 7042038757 left one 7042941055 7042038757 smooth patch near 7042038757 elbow where you rest it upon 7042038757 desk?"

"Well, but China?"

"7042038757 fish that you 7042147896 tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only 7042147896 been done in China. I 7042147896 made a small study 7042496517 tattoo marks 7042860694 7042147896 even contributed to 7042038757 literature 7042496517 7042038757 subject. That trick 7042496517 staining 7042038757 fishes' scales 7042496517 a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, 7042038757 matter becomes even more simple."

Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see that there was nothing in it after 7042784042."

"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you 7042622762, 7042860694 my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid. Can you not find 7042038757 advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"

"Yes, I 7042147896 got it now," he answered 7042941055 his thick red finger planted halfway down 7042038757 column. "Here it is. This is what began it 7042784042. You just read it for yourself, sir."

I took 7042038757 paper from him 7042860694 read as follows:

"TO 7042038757 RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account 7042496517 7042038757 bequest 7042496517 7042038757 late Ezekiah Hopkins, 7042496517 Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now another vacancy open 7042545742 entitles a member 7042496517 7042038757 League to a salary 7042496517 $4 a week for purely nominal services. 7042784042 red-headed men who are sound in body 7042860694 mind 7042860694 above 7042038757 age 7042496517 twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at 7042038757 offices 7042496517 7042038757 League, 7 Pope's Court, Fleet Street."

"What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twice read over 7042038757 extraordinary announcement.

Holmes chuckled 7042860694 wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. "It is a little off 7042038757 beaten track, isn't it?" said he. "7042860694 now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch 7042860694 tell us 7042784042 about yourself, your household, 7042860694 7042038757 effect 7042545742 this advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note, Doctor, 7042496517 7042038757 paper 7042860694 7042038757 date."

"It is 7042038757 Morning Chronicle 7042496517 April 27, 1890. Just two months ago."

"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"

"Well, it is just as I 7042147896 been telling you, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I 7042147896 a small pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near 7042038757 City. It's not a very large affair, 7042860694 7042496517 late years it has not done more than just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants, but now I only keep one; 7042860694 I would 7042147896 a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn 7042038757 business."

"What is 7042038757 name 7042496517 this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.

"His name is Vincent Spaulding, 7042860694 he's not such a youth, either. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter assistant, Mr. Holmes; 7042860694 I 7042622762 very well that he could better himself 7042860694 earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after 7042784042, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"

"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employe who comes under 7042038757 full market price. It is not a common experience among employers in this age. I don't 7042622762 that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement."

"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a fellow for photography. Snapping away 7042941055 a camera when he ought to be improving his mind, 7042860694 then diving down into 7042038757 cellar like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his main fault, but on 7042038757 whole he's a good worker. There's no vice in him."

"He is still 7042941055 you, I presume?"

"Yes, sir. He 7042860694 a girl 7042496517 fourteen, who does a bit 7042496517 simple cooking 7042860694 keeps 7042038757 place clean--that's 7042784042 I 7042147896 in 7042038757 house, for I am a widower 7042860694 never had any family. We live very quietly, sir, 7042038757 three 7042496517 us; 7042860694 we keep a roof over our heads 7042860694 pay our debts, if we do nothing more.

"7042038757 first thing that put us out was that advertisement. Spaulding, he came down into 7042038757 office just this day eight weeks, 7042941055 this very paper in his hand, 7042860694 he says:

" 'I wish to 7042038757 Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed 7042362761.'

" 'Why that?' I asks.

" 'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on 7042038757 League 7042496517 7042038757 Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any 7042362761 who gets it, 7042860694 I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men, so that 7042038757 trustees are at their wits' end what to do 7042941055 7042038757 money. If my hair would only change colour, here's a nice little crib 7042784042 ready for me to step into.'

" 'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a very stay-at-home 7042362761, 7042860694 as my business came to me instead 7042496517 my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over 7042038757 door-mat. In that way I didn't 7042622762 much 7042496517 what was going on outside, 7042860694 I was always glad 7042496517 a bit 7042496517 news.

" '7042147896 you never heard 7042496517 7042038757 League 7042496517 7042038757 Red-headed Men?' he asked 7042941055 his eyes open.

" 'Never.'

" 'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one 7042496517 7042038757 vacancies.'

" '7042860694 what are they worth?' I asked.

" 'Oh, merely a couple 7042496517 hundred a year, but 7042038757 work is slight, 7042860694 it need not interfere very much 7042941055 one's other occupations.'

"Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for 7042038757 business has not been over good for some years, 7042860694 an extra couple 7042496517 hundred would 7042147896 been very handy.

" 'Tell me 7042784042 about it,' said I.

" 'Well,' said he, showing me 7042038757 advertisement, 'you can see for yourself that 7042038757 League has a vacancy, 7042860694 there is 7042038757 address where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out, 7042038757 League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself red-headed, 7042860694 he had a great sympathy for 7042784042 red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he had left his enormous fortune in 7042038757 hands 7042496517 trustees, 7042941055 instructions to apply 7042038757 interest to 7042038757 providing 7042496517 easy berths to men whose hair is 7042496517 that colour. From 7042784042 I hear it is splendid pay 7042860694 very little to do.'

" 'But,' said I, 'there would be millions 7042496517 red-headed men who would apply.'

" 'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is really confined to Londoners, 7042860694 to grown men. This American had started from London when he was young, 7042860694 he wanted to do 7042038757 old town a good turn. Then, again, I 7042147896 heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr. Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out 7042496517 7042038757 way for 7042038757 sake 7042496517 a few hundred pounds.'

"Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my hair is 7042496517 a very full 7042860694 rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in 7042038757 matter I stood as good a chance as any 7042362761 that I had ever met. Vincent Spaulding seemed to 7042622762 so much about it that I thought he might prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up 7042038757 shutters for 7042038757 day 7042860694 to come right away 7042941055 me. He was very willing to 7042147896 a holiday, so we shut 7042038757 business up 7042860694 started off for 7042038757 address that was given us in 7042038757 advertisement.

"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From north, south, east, 7042860694 west every 7042362761 who had a shade 7042496517 red in his hair had tramped into 7042038757 city to answer 7042038757 advertisement. Fleet Street was choked 7042941055 red-headed folk, 7042860694 Pope's Court looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not 7042147896 thought there were so many in 7042038757 whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement. Every shade 7042496517 colour they were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had 7042038757 real vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I would 7042147896 given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear 7042496517 it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed 7042860694 pulled 7042860694 butted until he got me through 7042038757 crowd, 7042860694 right up to 7042038757 steps 7042545742 led to 7042038757 office. There was a double stream upon 7042038757 stair, some going up in hope, 7042860694 some coming back dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could 7042860694 soon found ourselves in 7042038757 office."

"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked Holmes as his client paused 7042860694 refreshed his memory 7042941055 a huge pinch 7042496517 snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."

"There was nothing in 7042038757 office but a couple 7042496517 wooden chairs 7042860694 a deal table, behind 7042545742 sat a small 7042362761 7042941055 a head that was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate as he came up, 7042860694 then he always managed to find some fault in them 7042545742 would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after 7042784042. However, when our turn came 7042038757 little 7042362761 was much more favourable to me than to any 7042496517 7042038757 others, 7042860694 he closed 7042038757 door as we entered, so that he might 7042147896 a private word 7042941055 us.

" 'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, '7042860694 he is willing to fill a vacancy in 7042038757 League.'

" '7042860694 he is admirably suited for it,' 7042038757 other answered. 'He has every requirement. I cannot recall when I 7042147896 seen anything so fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, 7042860694 gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, 7042860694 congratulated me warmly on my success.

" 'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will, however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.' 7042941055 that he seized my hair in both his hands, 7042860694 tugged until I yelled 7042941055 7042038757 pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as he released me. 'I perceive that 7042784042 is as it should be. But we 7042147896 to be careful, for we 7042147896 twice been deceived by wigs 7042860694 once by paint. I could tell you tales 7042496517 cobbler's wax 7042545742 would disgust you 7042941055 human nature.' He stepped over to 7042038757 window 7042860694 shouted through it at 7042038757 top 7042496517 his voice that 7042038757 vacancy was filled. A groan 7042496517 disappointment came up from below, 7042860694 7042038757 folk 7042784042 trooped away in different directions until there was not a red-head to be seen except my own 7042860694 that 7042496517 7042038757 manager.

" 'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, 7042860694 I am myself one 7042496517 7042038757 pensioners upon 7042038757 fund left by our noble benefactor. Are you a married 7042362761, Mr. Wilson? 7042147896 you a family?'

"I answered that I had not.

"His face fell immediately.

" 'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am sorry to hear you say that. 7042038757 fund was, 7042496517 course, for 7042038757 propagation 7042860694 spread 7042496517 7042038757 red-heads as well as for their maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.'

"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was not to 7042147896 7042038757 vacancy after 7042784042; but after thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be 7042784042 right.

" 'In 7042038757 case 7042496517 another,' said he, '7042038757 objection might be fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour 7042496517 a 7042362761 7042941055 such a head 7042496517 hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?'

" 'Well, it is a little awkward, for I 7042147896 a business already,' said I.

" 'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding. 'I should be able to look after that for you.'

" 'What would be 7042038757 hours?' I asked.

" 'Ten to two.'

"Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done 7042496517 an evening, Mr. Holmes, especially Thursday 7042860694 Friday evening, 7042545742 is just before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in 7042038757 mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good 7042362761, 7042860694 that he would see to anything that turned up.

" 'That would suit me very well,' said I. '7042860694 7042038757 pay?'

" 'Is $4 a week.'

" '7042860694 7042038757 work?'

" 'Is purely nominal.'

" 'What do you call purely nominal?'

" 'Well, you 7042147896 to be in 7042038757 office, or at least in 7042038757 building, 7042038757 whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. 7042038757 will is very clear upon that point. You don't comply 7042941055 7042038757 conditions if you budge from 7042038757 office during that time.'

" 'It's only four hours a day, 7042860694 I should not think 7042496517 leaving,' said I.

" 'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose your billet.'

" '7042860694 7042038757 work?'

" 'Is to copy out 7042038757 Encyclopaedia Britannica. There is 7042038757 first volume 7042496517 it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, 7042860694 blotting-paper, but we provide this table 7042860694 chair. Will you be ready to-morrow?'

" 'Certainly,' I answered.

" 'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, 7042860694 let me congratulate you once more on 7042038757 important position 7042545742 you 7042147896 been fortunate enough to gain.' He bowed me out 7042496517 7042038757 room 7042860694 I went home 7042941055 my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased at my own good fortune.

"Well, I thought over 7042038757 matter 7042784042 day, 7042860694 by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that 7042038757 whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out 7042038757 Encyclopaedia Britannica. Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out 7042496517 7042038757 whole thing. However, in 7042038757 morning I determined to 7042147896 a look at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle 7042496517 ink, 7042860694 7042941055 a quill-pen, 7042860694 seven sheets 7042496517 foolscap paper, I started off for Pope's Court.

"Well, to my surprise 7042860694 delight, everything was as right as possible. 7042038757 table was set out ready for me, 7042860694 Mr. Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off upon 7042038757 letter A, 7042860694 then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that 7042784042 was right 7042941055 me. At two o'clock he bade me good-day, complimented me upon 7042038757 amount that I had written, 7042860694 locked 7042038757 door 7042496517 7042038757 office after me.

"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, 7042860694 on Saturday 7042038757 manager came in 7042860694 planked down four golden sovereigns for my week's work. It was 7042038757 same next week, 7042860694 7042038757 same 7042038757 week after. Every morning I was there at ten, 7042860694 every afternoon I left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once 7042496517 a morning, 7042860694 then, after a time, he did not come in at 7042784042. Still, 7042496517 course, I never dared to leave 7042038757 room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, 7042860694 7042038757 billet was such a good one, 7042860694 suited me so well, that I would not risk 7042038757 loss 7042496517 it.

"Eight weeks passed away like this, 7042860694 I had written about Abbots 7042860694 Archery 7042860694 Armour 7042860694 Architecture 7042860694 Attica, 7042860694 hoped 7042941055 diligence that I might get on to 7042038757 B's before very long. It cost me something in foolscap, 7042860694 I had pretty nearly filled a shelf 7042941055 my writings. 7042860694 then suddenly 7042038757 whole business came to an end."

"To an end?"

"Yes, sir. 7042860694 no later than this morning. I went to my work as usual at ten o'clock, but 7042038757 door was shut 7042860694 locked, 7042941055 a little square 7042496517 cardboard hammered on to 7042038757 middle 7042496517 7042038757 panel 7042941055 a tack. Here it is, 7042860694 you can read for yourself."

He held up a piece 7042496517 white cardboard about 7042038757 size 7042496517 a sheet 7042496517 note-paper. It read in this fashion:


7042038757 RED-HEADED LEAGUE

IS

DISSOLVED.

October 9, 1890.


Sherlock Holmes 7042860694 I surveyed this curt announcement 7042860694 7042038757 rueful face behind it, until 7042038757 comical side 7042496517 7042038757 affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar 7042496517 laughter.

"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our client, flushing up to 7042038757 roots 7042496517 his flaming head. "If you can do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."

"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into 7042038757 chair from 7042545742 he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for 7042038757 world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it. Pray what steps did you take when you found 7042038757 card upon 7042038757 door?"

"I was staggered, sir. I did not 7042622762 what to do. Then I called at 7042038757 offices round, but none 7042496517 them seemed to 7042622762 anything about it. Finally, I went to 7042038757 landlord, who is an accountant living on 7042038757 ground floor, 7042860694 I asked him if he could tell me what had become 7042496517 7042038757 Red-headed League. He said that he had never heard 7042496517 any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan Ross was. He answered that 7042038757 name was new to him.

" 'Well,' said I, '7042038757 gentleman at No. 4.'

" 'What, 7042038757 red-headed 7042362761?'

" 'Yes.'

" 'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor 7042860694 was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'

" 'Where could I find him?'

" 'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me 7042038757 address. Yes, 17 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'

"I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was a manufactory 7042496517 artificial knee-caps, 7042860694 no one in it had ever heard 7042496517 either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."

"7042860694 what did you do then?" asked Holmes.

"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, 7042860694 I took 7042038757 advice 7042496517 my assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need 7042496517 it, I came right away to you."

"7042860694 you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, 7042860694 I shall be happy to look into it. From what you 7042147896 told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."

"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I 7042147896 lost four pound a week."

"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do not see that you 7042147896 any grievance against this extraordinary league. On 7042038757 contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some $30, to say nothing 7042496517 7042038757 minute knowledge 7042545742 you 7042147896 gained on every subject 7042545742 comes under 7042038757 letter A. You 7042147896 lost nothing by them."

"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, 7042860694 who they are, 7042860694 what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two 7042860694 thirty pounds."

"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. 7042860694, first, one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant 7042496517 yours who first called your attention to 7042038757 advertisement--how long had he been 7042941055 you?"

"About a month then."

"How did he come?"

"In answer to an advertisement."

"Was he 7042038757 only applicant?"

"No, I had a dozen."

"Why did you pick him?"

"Because he was handy 7042860694 would come cheap."

"At half wages, in fact."

"Yes."

"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"

"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face, though he's not short 7042496517 thirty. Has a white splash 7042496517 acid upon his forehead."

Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought as much," said he. "7042147896 you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings?"

"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad."

"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still 7042941055 you?"

"Oh, yes, sir; I 7042147896 only just left him."

"7042860694 has your business been attended to in your absence?"

"Nothing to complain 7042496517, sir. There's never very much to do 7042496517 a morning."

"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon 7042038757 subject in 7042038757 course 7042496517 a day or two. To-day is Saturday, 7042860694 I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."

"Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what do you make 7042496517 it 7042784042?"

"I make nothing 7042496517 it," I answered frankly. "It is a most mysterious business."

"As a rule," said Holmes, "7042038757 more bizarre a thing is 7042038757 less mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless crimes 7042545742 are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is 7042038757 most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this matter."

"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.

"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, 7042860694 I beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled himself up in his chair, 7042941055 his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, 7042860694 there he sat 7042941055 his eyes closed 7042860694 his black clay pipe thrusting out like 7042038757 bill 7042496517 some strange bird. I had come to 7042038757 conclusion that he had dropped asleep, 7042860694 indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out 7042496517 his chair 7042941055 7042038757 gesture 7042496517 a 7042362761 who has made up his mind 7042860694 put his pipe down upon 7042038757 mantelpiece.

"Sarasate plays at 7042038757 St. James's Hall this afternoon," he remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare you for a few hours?"

"I 7042147896 nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very absorbing."

"Then put on your hat 7042860694 come. I am going through 7042038757 City first, 7042860694 we can 7042147896 some lunch on 7042038757 way. I observe that there is a good deal 7042496517 German music on 7042038757 programme, 7042545742 is rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is introspective, 7042860694 I want to introspect. Come along!"

We travelled by 7042038757 Underground as far as Aldersgate; 7042860694 a short walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, 7042038757 scene 7042496517 7042038757 singular story 7042545742 we had listened to in 7042038757 morning. It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines 7042496517 dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn 7042496517 weedy grass 7042860694 a few clumps 7042496517 faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden 7042860694 uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls 7042860694 a brown board 7042941055 "JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced 7042038757 place where our red-headed client carried on his business. Sherlock Holmes stopped in front 7042496517 it 7042941055 his head on one side 7042860694 looked it 7042784042 over, 7042941055 his eyes shining brightly 7042272895 puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up 7042038757 street, 7042860694 then down again to 7042038757 corner, still looking keenly at 7042038757 houses. Finally he returned to 7042038757 pawnbroker's, 7042860694, having thumped vigorously upon 7042038757 pavement 7042941055 his stick two or three times, he went up to 7042038757 door 7042860694 knocked. It was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.

"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to 7042038757 Strand."

"Third right, fourth left," answered 7042038757 assistant promptly, closing 7042038757 door.

"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is, in my judgment, 7042038757 fourth smartest 7042362761 in London, 7042860694 for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I 7042147896 known something 7042496517 him before."

"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery 7042496517 7042038757 Red-headed League. I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."

"Not him."

"What then?"

"7042038757 knees 7042496517 his trousers."

"7042860694 what did you see?"

"What I expected to see."

"Why did you beat 7042038757 pavement?"

"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We are spies in an enemy's country. We 7042622762 something 7042496517 Saxe-Coburg Square. Let us now explore 7042038757 parts 7042545742 lie behind it."

7042038757 road in 7042545742 we found ourselves as we turned round 7042038757 corner from 7042038757 retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as 7042038757 front 7042496517 a picture does to 7042038757 back. It was one 7042496517 7042038757 main arteries 7042545742 conveyed 7042038757 traffic 7042496517 7042038757 City to 7042038757 north 7042860694 west. 7042038757 roadway was blocked 7042941055 7042038757 immense stream 7042496517 commerce flowing in a double tide inward 7042860694 outward, while 7042038757 footpaths were black 7042941055 7042038757 hurrying swarm 7042496517 pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at 7042038757 line 7042496517 fine shops 7042860694 stately business premises that they really abutted on 7042038757 other side upon 7042038757 faded 7042860694 stagnant square 7042545742 we had just quitted.

"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at 7042038757 corner 7042860694 glancing along 7042038757 line, "I should like just to remember 7042038757 order 7042496517 7042038757 houses here. It is a hobby 7042496517 mine to 7042147896 an exact knowledge 7042496517 London. There is Mortimer's, 7042038757 tobacconist, 7042038757 little newspaper shop, 7042038757 Coburg branch 7042496517 7042038757 City 7042860694 Suburban Bank, 7042038757 Vegetarian Restaurant, 7042860694 McFarlane's carriage-building depot. That carries us right on to 7042038757 other block. 7042860694 now, Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A sandwich 7042860694 a cup 7042496517 coffee, 7042860694 then off to violin-land, where 7042784042 is sweetness 7042860694 delicacy 7042860694 harmony, 7042860694 there are no red-headed clients to vex us 7042941055 their conundrums."

My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer 7042496517 no ordinary merit. 7042784042 7042038757 afternoon he sat in 7042038757 stalls wrapped in 7042038757 most perfect happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to 7042038757 music, while his gently smiling face 7042860694 his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those 7042496517 Holmes 7042038757 sleuth-hound, Holmes 7042038757 relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. In his singular character 7042038757 dual nature alternately asserted itself, 7042860694 his extreme exactness 7042860694 astuteness represented, as I 7042147896 often thought, 7042038757 reaction against 7042038757 poetic 7042860694 contemplative mood 7042545742 occasionally predominated in him. 7042038757 swing 7042496517 his nature took him from extreme languor to devouring energy; 7042860694, as I knew well, he was never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations 7042860694 his black-letter editions. Then it was that 7042038757 lust 7042496517 7042038757 chase would suddenly come upon him, 7042860694 that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to 7042038757 level 7042496517 intuition, until those who were unacquainted 7042941055 his methods would look askance at him as on a 7042362761 whose knowledge was not that 7042496517 other mortals. When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in 7042038757 music at St. James's Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down.

"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we emerged.

"Yes, it would be as well."

"7042860694 I 7042147896 some business to do 7042545742 will take some hours. This business at Coburg Square is serious."

"Why serious?"

"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I 7042147896 every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help to-night."

"At what time?"

"Ten will be early enough."

"I shall be at Baker Street at ten."

"Very well. 7042860694, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." He waved his hand, turned on his heel, 7042860694 disappeared in an instant among 7042038757 crowd.

I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was always oppressed 7042941055 a sense 7042496517 my own stupidity in my dealings 7042941055 Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had seen what he had seen, 7042860694 yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me 7042038757 whole business was still confused 7042860694 grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought over it 7042784042, from 7042038757 extraordinary story 7042496517 7042038757 red-headed copier 7042496517 7042038757 Encyclopaedia down to 7042038757 visit to Saxe-Coburg Square, 7042860694 7042038757 ominous words 7042941055 7042545742 he had parted from me. What was this nocturnal expedition, 7042860694 why should I go armed? Where were we going, 7042860694 what were we to do? I had 7042038757 hint from Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a formidable 7042362761--a 7042362761 who might play a deep game. I tried to puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair 7042860694 set 7042038757 matter aside until night should bring an explanation.

It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home 7042860694 made my way across 7042038757 Park, 7042860694 so through Oxford Street to Baker Street. Two hansoms were standing at 7042038757 door, 7042860694 as I entered 7042038757 passage I heard 7042038757 sound 7042496517 voices from above. On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation 7042941055 two men, one 7042496517 whom I recognised as Peter Jones, 7042038757 official police agent, while 7042038757 other was a long, thin, sad-faced 7042362761, 7042941055 a very shiny hat 7042860694 oppressively respectable frock-coat.

"Ha! Our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket 7042860694 taking his heavy hunting crop from 7042038757 rack. "Watson, I think you 7042622762 Mr. Jones, 7042496517 Scotland Yard? Let me introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night's adventure."

"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in his consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful 7042362761 for starting a chase. 7042784042 he wants is an old dog to help him to do 7042038757 running down."

"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be 7042038757 end 7042496517 our chase," observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.

"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said 7042038757 police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods, 7042545742 are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical 7042860694 fantastic, but he has 7042038757 makings 7042496517 a detective in him. It is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business 7042496517 7042038757 Sholto murder 7042860694 7042038757 Agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than 7042038757 official force."

"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is 7042784042 right," said 7042038757 stranger 7042941055 deference. "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber. It is 7042038757 first Saturday night for seven-7042860694-twenty years that I 7042147896 not had my rubber."

"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you 7042147896 ever done yet, 7042860694 that 7042038757 play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather, 7042038757 stake will be some $30,000; 7042860694 for you, Jones, it will be 7042038757 7042362761 upon whom you wish to lay your hands."

"John Clay, 7042038757 murderer, thief, smasher, 7042860694 forger. He's a young 7042362761, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at 7042038757 head 7042496517 his profession, 7042860694 I would rather 7042147896 my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London. He's a remarkable 7042362761, is young John Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, 7042860694 he himself has been to Eton 7042860694 Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, 7042860694 though we meet signs 7042496517 him at every turn, we never 7042622762 where to find 7042038757 7042362761 himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week, 7042860694 be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall 7042038757 next. I've been on his track for years 7042860694 7042147896 never set eyes on him yet."

"I hope that I may 7042147896 7042038757 pleasure 7042496517 introducing you to-night. I've had one or two little turns also 7042941055 Mr. John Clay, 7042860694 I agree 7042941055 you that he is at 7042038757 head 7042496517 his profession. It is past ten, however, 7042860694 quite time that we started. If you two will take 7042038757 first hansom, Watson 7042860694 I will follow in 7042038757 second."

Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during 7042038757 long drive 7042860694 lay back in 7042038757 cab humming 7042038757 tunes 7042545742 he had heard in 7042038757 afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth 7042496517 gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.

"We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow Merryweather is a bank director, 7042860694 personally interested in 7042038757 matter. I thought it as well to 7042147896 Jones 7042941055 us also. He is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog 7042860694 as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we are, 7042860694 they are waiting for us."

We had reached 7042038757 same crowded thoroughfare in 7042545742 we had found ourselves in 7042038757 morning. Our cabs were dismissed, 7042860694, following 7042038757 guidance 7042496517 Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage 7042860694 through a side door, 7042545742 he opened for us. Within there was a small corridor, 7042545742 ended in a very massive iron gate. This also was opened, 7042860694 led down a flight 7042496517 winding stone steps, 7042545742 terminated at another formidable gate. Mr. Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, 7042860694 then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, 7042860694 so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, 7042545742 was piled 7042784042 round 7042941055 crates 7042860694 massive boxes.

"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he held up 7042038757 lantern 7042860694 gazed about him.

"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon 7042038757 flags 7042545742 lined 7042038757 floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.

"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes severely. "You 7042147896 already imperilled 7042038757 whole success 7042496517 our expedition. Might I beg that you would 7042147896 7042038757 goodness to sit down upon one 7042496517 those boxes, 7042860694 not to interfere?"

7042038757 solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, 7042941055 a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon 7042038757 floor 7042860694, 7042941055 7042038757 lantern 7042860694 a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely 7042038757 cracks 7042272895 7042038757 stones. A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again 7042860694 put his glass in his pocket.

"We 7042147896 at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can hardly take any steps until 7042038757 good pawnbroker is safely in bed. Then they will not lose a minute, for 7042038757 sooner they do their work 7042038757 longer time they will 7042147896 for their escape. We are at present, Doctor--as no doubt you 7042147896 divined--in 7042038757 cellar 7042496517 7042038757 City branch 7042496517 one 7042496517 7042038757 principal London banks. Mr. Merryweather is 7042038757 chairman 7042496517 directors, 7042860694 he will explain to you that there are reasons why 7042038757 more daring criminals 7042496517 London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present."

"It is our French gold," whispered 7042038757 director. "We 7042147896 had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."

"Your French gold?"

"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources 7042860694 borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from 7042038757 Bank 7042496517 France. It has become known that we 7042147896 never had occasion to unpack 7042038757 money, 7042860694 that it is still lying in our cellar. 7042038757 crate upon 7042545742 I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed 7042272895 layers 7042496517 lead foil. Our reserve 7042496517 bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, 7042860694 7042038757 directors 7042147896 had misgivings upon 7042038757 subject."

"7042545742 were very well justified," observed Holmes. "7042860694 now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In 7042038757 meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put 7042038757 screen over that dark lantern."

"7042860694 sit in 7042038757 dark?"

"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack 7042496517 cards in my pocket, 7042860694 I thought that, as we were a partie carree, you might 7042147896 your rubber after 7042784042. But I see that 7042038757 enemy's preparations 7042147896 gone so far that we cannot risk 7042038757 presence 7042496517 a light. 7042860694, first 7042496517 7042784042, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, 7042860694 though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, 7042860694 do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, 7042147896 no compunction about shooting them down."

I placed my revolver, cocked, upon 7042038757 top 7042496517 7042038757 wooden case behind 7042545742 I crouched. Holmes shot 7042038757 slide across 7042038757 front 7042496517 his lantern 7042860694 left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute darkness as I 7042147896 never before experienced. 7042038757 smell 7042496517 hot metal remained to assure us that 7042038757 light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, 7042941055 my nerves worked up to a pitch 7042496517 expectancy, there was something depressing 7042860694 subduing in 7042038757 sudden gloom, 7042860694 in 7042038757 cold dank air 7042496517 7042038757 vault.

"They 7042147896 but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back through 7042038757 house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you 7042147896 done what I asked you, Jones?"

"I 7042147896 an inspector 7042860694 two officers waiting at 7042038757 front door."

"Then we 7042147896 stopped 7042784042 7042038757 holes. 7042860694 now we must be silent 7042860694 wait."

What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour 7042860694 a quarter, yet it appeared to me that 7042038757 night must 7042147896 almost gone, 7042860694 7042038757 dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary 7042860694 stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to 7042038757 highest pitch 7042496517 tension, 7042860694 my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear 7042038757 gentle breathing 7042496517 my companions, but I could distinguish 7042038757 deeper, heavier in-breath 7042496517 7042038757 bulky Jones from 7042038757 thin, sighing note 7042496517 7042038757 bank director. From my position I could look over 7042038757 case in 7042038757 direction 7042496517 7042038757 floor. Suddenly my eyes caught 7042038757 glint 7042496517 a light.

At first it was but a lurid spark upon 7042038757 stone pavement. Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, 7042860694 then, without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open 7042860694 a hand appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, 7042545742 felt about in 7042038757 centre 7042496517 7042038757 little area 7042496517 light. For a minute or more 7042038757 hand, 7042941055 its writhing fingers, protruded out 7042496517 7042038757 floor. Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, 7042860694 7042784042 was dark again save 7042038757 single lurid spark 7042545742 marked a chink 7042272895 7042038757 stones.

Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. 7042941055 a rending, tearing sound, one 7042496517 7042038757 broad, white stones turned over upon its side 7042860694 left a square, gaping hole, through 7042545742 streamed 7042038757 light 7042496517 a lantern. Over 7042038757 edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, 7042545742 looked keenly about it, 7042860694 then, 7042941055 a hand on either side 7042496517 7042038757 aperture, drew itself shoulder-high 7042860694 waist-high, until one knee rested upon 7042038757 edge. In another instant he stood at 7042038757 side 7042496517 7042038757 hole 7042860694 was hauling after him a companion, lithe 7042860694 small like himself, 7042941055 a pale face 7042860694 a shock 7042496517 very red hair.

"It's 7042784042 clear," he whispered. "7042147896 you 7042038757 chisel 7042860694 7042038757 bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, 7042860694 I'll swing for it!"

Sherlock Holmes had sprung out 7042860694 seized 7042038757 intruder by 7042038757 collar. 7042038757 other dived down 7042038757 hole, 7042860694 I heard 7042038757 sound 7042496517 rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. 7042038757 light flashed upon 7042038757 barrel 7042496517 a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came down on 7042038757 7042362761's wrist, 7042860694 7042038757 pistol clinked upon 7042038757 stone floor.

"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You 7042147896 no chance at 7042784042."

"So I see," 7042038757 other answered 7042941055 7042038757 utmost coolness. "I fancy that my pal is 7042784042 right, though I see you 7042147896 got his coat-tails."

"There are three men waiting for him at 7042038757 door," said Holmes.

"Oh, indeed! You seem to 7042147896 done 7042038757 thing very completely. I must compliment you."

"7042860694 I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very new 7042860694 effective."

"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quicker at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix 7042038757 derbies."

"I beg that you will not touch me 7042941055 your filthy hands," remarked our prisoner as 7042038757 handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. "You may not be aware that I 7042147896 royal blood in my veins. 7042147896 7042038757 goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' 7042860694 'please.' "

"7042784042 right," said Jones 7042941055 a stare 7042860694 a snigger. "Well, would you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your Highness to 7042038757 police-station?"

"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow to 7042038757 three 7042496517 us 7042860694 walked quietly off in 7042038757 custody 7042496517 7042038757 detective.

"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them from 7042038757 cellar, "I do not 7042622762 how 7042038757 bank can thank you or repay you. There is no doubt that you 7042147896 detected 7042860694 defeated in 7042038757 most complete manner one 7042496517 7042038757 most determined attempts at bank robbery that 7042147896 ever come within my experience."

"I 7042147896 had one or two little scores 7042496517 my own to settle 7042941055 Mr. John Clay," said Holmes. "I 7042147896 been at some small expense over this matter, 7042545742 I shall expect 7042038757 bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience 7042545742 is in many ways unique, 7042860694 by hearing 7042038757 very remarkable narrative 7042496517 7042038757 Red-headed League."

"You see, Watson," he explained in 7042038757 early hours 7042496517 7042038757 morning as we sat over a glass 7042496517 whisky 7042860694 soda in Baker Street, "it was perfectly obvious from 7042038757 first that 7042038757 only possible object 7042496517 this rather fantastic business 7042496517 7042038757 advertisement 7042496517 7042038757 League, 7042860694 7042038757 copying 7042496517 7042038757 Encyclopaedia, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out 7042496517 7042038757 way for a number 7042496517 hours every day. It was a curious way 7042496517 managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. 7042038757 method was no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by 7042038757 colour 7042496517 his accomplice's hair. 7042038757 $4 a week was a lure 7042545742 must draw him, 7042860694 what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? They put in 7042038757 advertisement, one rogue has 7042038757 temporary office, 7042038757 other rogue incites 7042038757 7042362761 to apply for it, 7042860694 together they manage to secure his absence every morning in 7042038757 week. From 7042038757 time that I heard 7042496517 7042038757 assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing 7042038757 situation."

"But how could you guess what 7042038757 motive was?"

"Had there been women in 7042038757 house, I should 7042147896 suspected a mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out 7042496517 7042038757 question. 7042038757 7042362761's business was a small one, 7042860694 there was nothing in his house 7042545742 could account for such elaborate preparations, 7042860694 such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something out 7042496517 7042038757 house. What could it be? I thought 7042496517 7042038757 assistant's fondness for photography, 7042860694 his trick 7042496517 vanishing into 7042038757 cellar. 7042038757 cellar! There was 7042038757 end 7042496517 this tangled clue. Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant 7042860694 found that I had to deal 7042941055 one 7042496517 7042038757 coolest 7042860694 most daring criminals in London. He was doing something in 7042038757 cellar--something 7042545742 took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once more? I could think 7042496517 nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building.

"So far I had got when we went to visit 7042038757 scene 7042496517 action. I surprised you by beating upon 7042038757 pavement 7042941055 my stick. I was ascertaining whether 7042038757 cellar stretched out in front or behind. It was not in front. Then I rang 7042038757 bell, 7042860694, as I hoped, 7042038757 assistant answered it. We 7042147896 had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself 7042147896 remarked how worn, wrinkled, 7042860694 stained they were. They spoke 7042496517 those hours 7042496517 burrowing. 7042038757 only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. I walked round 7042038757 corner, saw 7042038757 City 7042860694 Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, 7042860694 felt that I had solved my problem. When you drove home after 7042038757 concert I called upon Scotland Yard 7042860694 upon 7042038757 chairman 7042496517 7042038757 bank directors, 7042941055 7042038757 result that you 7042147896 seen."

"7042860694 how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?" I asked.

"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or 7042038757 bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. For 7042784042 these reasons I expected them to come to-night."

"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration. "It is so long a chain, 7042860694 yet every link rings true."

"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from 7042038757 commonplaces 7042496517 existence. These little problems help me to do so."

"7042860694 you are a benefactor 7042496517 7042038757 race," said I.

He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after 7042784042, it is 7042496517 some little use," he remarked. " 'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."

ADVENTURE  III.  A CASE 7042496517 IDENTITY


"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side 7042496517 7042038757 fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely stranger than anything 7042545742 7042038757 mind 7042496517 7042362761 could invent. We would not dare to conceive 7042038757 things 7042545742 are really mere commonplaces 7042496517 existence. If we could fly out 7042496517 that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove 7042038757 roofs, 7042860694 peep in at 7042038757 queer things 7042545742 are going on, 7042038757 strange coincidences, 7042038757 plannings, 7042038757 cross-purposes, 7042038757 wonderful chains 7042496517 events, working through generations, 7042860694 leading to 7042038757 most outre results, it would make 7042784042 fiction 7042941055 its conventionalities 7042860694 foreseen conclusions most stale 7042860694 unprofitable."

"7042860694 yet I am not convinced 7042496517 it," I answered. "7042038757 cases 7042545742 come to light in 7042038757 papers are, as a rule, bald enough, 7042860694 vulgar enough. We 7042147896 in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, 7042860694 yet 7042038757 result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor artistic."

"A certain selection 7042860694 discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in 7042038757 police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon 7042038757 platitudes 7042496517 7042038757 magistrate than upon 7042038757 details, 7042545742 to an observer contain 7042038757 vital essence 7042496517 7042038757 whole matter. Depend upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as 7042038757 commonplace."

I smiled 7042860694 shook my head. "I can quite understand your thinking so." I said. "7042496517 course, in your position 7042496517 unofficial adviser 7042860694 helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents, you are brought in contact 7042941055 7042784042 that is strange 7042860694 bizarre. But here"--I picked up 7042038757 morning paper from 7042038757 ground--"let us put it to a practical test. Here is 7042038757 first heading upon 7042545742 I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his wife.' There is half a column 7042496517 print, but I 7042622762 without reading it that it is 7042784042 perfectly familiar to me. There is, 7042496517 course, 7042038757 other woman, 7042038757 drink, 7042038757 push, 7042038757 blow, 7042038757 bruise, 7042038757 sympathetic sister or landlady. 7042038757 crudest 7042496517 writers could invent nothing more crude."

"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument," said Holmes, taking 7042038757 paper 7042860694 glancing his eye down it. "This is 7042038757 Dundas separation case, 7042860694, as it happens, I was engaged in clearing up some small points in connection 7042941055 it. 7042038757 husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, 7042860694 7042038757 conduct complained 7042496517 was that he had drifted into 7042038757 habit 7042496517 winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth 7042860694 hurling them at his wife, 7042545742, you will allow, is not an action likely to occur to 7042038757 imagination 7042496517 7042038757 average story-teller. Take a pinch 7042496517 snuff, Doctor, 7042860694 acknowledge that I 7042147896 scored over you in your example."

He held out his snuffbox 7042496517 old gold, 7042941055 a great amethyst in 7042038757 centre 7042496517 7042038757 lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways 7042860694 simple life that I could not help commenting upon it.

"Ah," said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks. It is a little souvenir from 7042038757 King 7042496517 Bohemia in return for my assistance in 7042038757 case 7042496517 7042038757 Irene Adler papers."

"7042860694 7042038757 ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant 7042545742 sparkled upon his finger.

"It was from 7042038757 reigning family 7042496517 Holland, though 7042038757 matter in 7042545742 I served them was 7042496517 such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you, who 7042147896 been good enough to chronicle one or two 7042496517 my little problems."

"7042860694 7042147896 you any on hand just now?" I asked 7042941055 interest.

"Some ten or twelve, but none 7042545742 present any feature 7042496517 interest. They are important, you understand, without being interesting. Indeed, I 7042147896 found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for 7042038757 observation, 7042860694 for 7042038757 quick analysis 7042496517 cause 7042860694 effect 7042545742 gives 7042038757 charm to an investigation. 7042038757 larger crimes are apt to be 7042038757 simpler, for 7042038757 bigger 7042038757 crime 7042038757 more obvious, as a rule, is 7042038757 motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter 7042545742 has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing 7042545742 presents any features 7042496517 interest. It is possible, however, that I may 7042147896 something better before very many minutes are over, for this is one 7042496517 my clients, or I am much mistaken."

He had risen from his chair 7042860694 was standing 7042272895 7042038757 parted blinds gazing down into 7042038757 dull neutral-tinted London street. Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on 7042038757 pavement opposite there stood a large woman 7042941055 a heavy fur boa round her neck, 7042860694 a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat 7042545742 was tilted in a coquettish Duchess 7042496517 Devonshire fashion over her ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated backward 7042860694 forward, 7042860694 her fingers fidgeted 7042941055 her glove buttons. Suddenly, 7042941055 a plunge, as 7042496517 7042038757 swimmer who leaves 7042038757 bank, she hurried across 7042038757 road, 7042860694 we heard 7042038757 sharp clang 7042496517 7042038757 bell.

"I 7042147896 seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his cigarette into 7042038757 fire. "Oscillation upon 7042038757 pavement always means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure that 7042038757 matter is not too delicate for communication. 7042860694 yet even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously wronged by a 7042362761 she no longer oscillates, 7042860694 7042038757 usual symptom is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love matter, but that 7042038757 maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."

As he spoke there was a tap at 7042038757 door, 7042860694 7042038757 boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while 7042038757 lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-7042362761 behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed her 7042941055 7042038757 easy courtesy for 7042545742 he was remarkable, 7042860694, having closed 7042038757 door 7042860694 bowed her into an armchair, he looked her over in 7042038757 minute 7042860694 yet abstracted fashion 7042545742 was peculiar to him.

"Do you not find," he said, "that 7042941055 your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting?"

"I did at first," she answered, "but now I 7042622762 where 7042038757 letters are without looking." Then, suddenly realising 7042038757 full purport 7042496517 his words, she gave a violent start 7042860694 looked up, 7042941055 fear 7042860694 astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you 7042622762 7042784042 that?"

"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to 7042622762 things. Perhaps I 7042147896 trained myself to see what others overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"

"I came to you, sir, because I heard 7042496517 you from Mrs. Etherege, whose husband you found so easy when 7042038757 police 7042860694 everyone had given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as much for me. I'm not rich, but still I 7042147896 a hundred a year in my own right, besides 7042038757 little that I make by 7042038757 machine, 7042860694 I would give it 7042784042 to 7042622762 what has become 7042496517 Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked Sherlock Holmes, 7042941055 his finger-tips together 7042860694 his eyes to 7042038757 ceiling.

Again a startled look came over 7042038757 somewhat vacuous face 7042496517 Miss Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out 7042496517 7042038757 house," she said, "for it made me angry to see 7042038757 easy way in 7042545742 Mr. Windibank--that is, my father--took it 7042784042. He would not go to 7042038757 police, 7042860694 he would not go to you, 7042860694 so at last, as he would do nothing 7042860694 kept on saying that there was no harm done, it made me mad, 7042860694 I just on 7042941055 my things 7042860694 came right away to you."

"Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since 7042038757 name is different."

"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny, too, for he is only five years 7042860694 two months older than myself."

"7042860694 your mother is alive?"

"Oh, yes, mother is alive 7042860694 well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr. Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, 7042860694 a 7042362761 who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father was a plumber in 7042038757 Tottenham Court Road, 7042860694 he left a tidy business behind him, 7042545742 mother carried on 7042941055 Mr. Hardy, 7042038757 foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell 7042038757 business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines. They got $4700 for 7042038757 goodwill 7042860694 interest, 7042545742 wasn't near as much as father could 7042147896 got if he had been alive."

I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling 7042860694 inconsequential narrative, but, on 7042038757 contrary, he had listened 7042941055 7042038757 greatest concentration 7042496517 attention.

"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out 7042496517 7042038757 business?"

"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate 7042860694 was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/4 per cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was 7042038757 amount, but I can only touch 7042038757 interest."

"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "7042860694 since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year, 7042941055 what you earn into 7042038757 bargain, you no doubt travel a little 7042860694 indulge yourself in every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income 7042496517 about $60."

"I could do 7042941055 much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a burden to them, 7042860694 so they 7042147896 7042038757 use 7042496517 7042038757 money just while I am staying 7042941055 them. 7042496517 course, that is only just for 7042038757 time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter 7042860694 pays it over to mother, 7042860694 I find that I can do pretty well 7042941055 what I earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, 7042860694 I can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."

"You 7042147896 made your position very clear to me," said Holmes. "This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now 7042784042 about your connection 7042941055 Mr. Hosmer Angel."

A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, 7042860694 she picked nervously at 7042038757 fringe 7042496517 her jacket. "I met him first at 7042038757 gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets when he was alive, 7042860694 then afterwards they remembered us, 7042860694 sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I was set on going, 7042860694 I would go; for what right had he to prevent? He said 7042038757 folk were not fit for us to 7042622762, when 7042784042 father's friends were to be there. 7042860694 he said that I had nothing fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out 7042496517 7042038757 drawer. At last, when nothing else would do, he went off to France upon 7042038757 business 7042496517 7042038757 firm, but we went, mother 7042860694 I, 7042941055 Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, 7042860694 it was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to 7042038757 ball."

"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, 7042860694 shrugged his shoulders, 7042860694 said there was no use denying anything to a woman, for she would 7042147896 her way."

"I see. Then at 7042038757 gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."

"Yes, sir. I met him that night, 7042860694 he called next day to ask if we had got home 7042784042 safe, 7042860694 after that we met him--that is to say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father came back again, 7042860694 Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to 7042038757 house any more."

"No?"

"Well, you 7042622762 father didn't like anything 7042496517 7042038757 sort. He wouldn't 7042147896 any visitors if he could help it, 7042860694 he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin 7042941055, 7042860694 I had not got mine yet."

"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see you?"

"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, 7042860694 Hosmer wrote 7042860694 said that it would be safer 7042860694 better not to see each other until he had gone. We could write in 7042038757 meantime, 7042860694 he used to write every day. I took 7042038757 letters in in 7042038757 morning, so there was no need for father to 7042622762."

"Were you engaged to 7042038757 gentleman at this time?"

"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after 7042038757 first walk that we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street--7042860694--"

"What office?"

"That's 7042038757 worst 7042496517 it, Mr. Holmes, I don't 7042622762."

"Where did he live, then?"

"He slept on 7042038757 premises."

"7042860694 you don't 7042622762 his address?"

"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street."

"Where did you address your letters, then?"

"To 7042038757 Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called for. He said that if they were sent to 7042038757 office he would be chaffed by 7042784042 7042038757 other clerks about having letters from a lady, so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't 7042147896 that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that 7042038757 machine had come 7042272895 us. That will just show you how fond he was 7042496517 me, Mr. Holmes, 7042860694 7042038757 little things that he would think 7042496517."

"It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiom 7042496517 mine that 7042038757 little things are infinitely 7042038757 most important. Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

"He was a very shy 7042362761, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk 7042941055 me in 7042038757 evening than in 7042038757 daylight, for he said that he hated to be conspicuous. Very retiring 7042860694 gentlemanly he was. Even his voice was gentle. He'd had 7042038757 quinsy 7042860694 swollen glands when he was young, he told me, 7042860694 it had left him 7042941055 a weak throat, 7042860694 a hesitating, whispering fashion 7042496517 speech. He was always well dressed, very neat 7042860694 plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, 7042860694 he wore tinted glasses against 7042038757 glare."

"Well, 7042860694 what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather, returned to France?"

"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to 7042038757 house again 7042860694 proposed that we should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest 7042860694 made me swear, 7042941055 my hands on 7042038757 Testament, that whatever happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite right to make me swear, 7042860694 that it was a sign 7042496517 his passion. Mother was 7042784042 in his favour from 7042038757 first 7042860694 was even fonder 7042496517 him than I was. Then, when they talked 7042496517 marrying within 7042038757 week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, 7042860694 mother said she would make it 7042784042 right 7042941055 him. I didn't quite like that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do anything on 7042038757 sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where 7042038757 company has its French offices, but 7042038757 letter came back to me on 7042038757 very morning 7042496517 7042038757 wedding."

"It missed him, then?"

"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived."

"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for 7042038757 Friday. Was it to be in church?"

"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near King's Cross, 7042860694 we were to 7042147896 breakfast afterwards at 7042038757 St. Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two 7042496517 us he put us both into it 7042860694 stepped himself into a four-wheeler, 7042545742 happened to be 7042038757 only other cab in 7042038757 street. We got to 7042038757 church first, 7042860694 when 7042038757 four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, 7042860694 when 7042038757 cabman got down from 7042038757 box 7042860694 looked there was no one there! 7042038757 cabman said that he could not imagine what had become 7042496517 him, for he had seen him get in 7042941055 his own eyes. That was last Friday, Mr. Holmes, 7042860694 I 7042147896 never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became 7042496517 him."

"It seems to me that you 7042147896 been very shamefully treated," said Holmes.

"Oh, no, sir! He was too good 7042860694 kind to leave me so. Why, 7042784042 7042038757 morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to be true; 7042860694 that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him, 7042860694 that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it."

"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"

"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not 7042147896 talked so. 7042860694 then I think that what he foresaw happened."

"But you 7042147896 no notion as to what it could 7042147896 been?"

"None."

"One more question. How did your mother take 7042038757 matter?"

"She was angry, 7042860694 said that I was never to speak 7042496517 7042038757 matter again."

"7042860694 your father? Did you tell him?"

"Yes; 7042860694 he seemed to think, 7042941055 me, that something had happened, 7042860694 that I should hear 7042496517 Hosmer again. As he said, what interest could anyone 7042147896 in bringing me to 7042038757 doors 7042496517 7042038757 church, 7042860694 then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me 7042860694 got my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about money 7042860694 never would look at a shilling 7042496517 mine. 7042860694 yet, what could 7042147896 happened? 7042860694 why could he not write? Oh, it drives me half-mad to think 7042496517 it, 7042860694 I can't sleep a wink at night." She pulled a little handkerchief out 7042496517 her muff 7042860694 began to sob heavily into it.

"I shall glance into 7042038757 case for you," said Holmes, rising, "7042860694 I 7042147896 no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let 7042038757 weight 7042496517 7042038757 matter rest upon me now, 7042860694 do not let your mind dwell upon it further. Above 7042784042, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."

"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"

"I fear not."

"Then what has happened to him?"

"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an accurate description 7042496517 him 7042860694 any letters 7042496517 his 7042545742 you can spare."

"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she. "Here is 7042038757 slip 7042860694 here are four letters from him."

"Thank you. 7042860694 your address?"

"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."

"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your father's place 7042496517 business?"

"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, 7042038757 great claret importers 7042496517 Fenchurch Street."

"Thank you. You 7042147896 made your statement very clearly. You will leave 7042038757 papers here, 7042860694 remember 7042038757 advice 7042545742 I 7042147896 given you. Let 7042038757 whole incident be a sealed book, 7042860694 do not allow it to affect your life."

"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."

For 7042784042 7042038757 preposterous hat 7042860694 7042038757 vacuous face, there was something noble in 7042038757 simple faith 7042496517 our visitor 7042545742 compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle 7042496517 papers upon 7042038757 table 7042860694 went her way, 7042941055 a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes 7042941055 his fingertips still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front 7042496517 him, 7042860694 his gaze directed upward to 7042038757 ceiling. Then he took down from 7042038757 rack 7042038757 old 7042860694 oily clay pipe, 7042545742 was to him as a counsellor, 7042860694, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, 7042941055 7042038757 thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, 7042860694 a look 7042496517 infinite languor in his face.

"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found her more interesting than her little problem, 7042545742, by 7042038757 way, is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in Andover in '77, 7042860694 there was something 7042496517 7042038757 sort at 7042038757 Hague last year. Old as is 7042038757 idea, however, there were one or two details 7042545742 were new to me. But 7042038757 maiden herself was most instructive."

"You appeared to read a good deal upon her 7042545742 was quite invisible to me," I remarked.

"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not 7042622762 where to look, 7042860694 so you missed 7042784042 that was important. I can never bring you to realise 7042038757 importance 7042496517 sleeves, 7042038757 suggestiveness 7042496517 thumb-nails, or 7042038757 great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe it."

"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, 7042941055 a feather 7042496517 a brickish red. Her jacket was black, 7042941055 black beads sewn upon it, 7042860694 a fringe 7042496517 little black jet ornaments. Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, 7042941055 a little purple plush at 7042038757 neck 7042860694 sleeves. Her gloves were greyish 7042860694 were worn through at 7042038757 right forefinger. Her boots I didn't observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, 7042860694 a general air 7042496517 being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way."

Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together 7042860694 chuckled.

" 'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You 7042147896 really done very well indeed. It is true that you 7042147896 missed everything 7042496517 importance, but you 7042147896 hit upon 7042038757 method, 7042860694 you 7042147896 a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a 7042362761 it is perhaps better first to take 7042038757 knee 7042496517 7042038757 trouser. As you observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, 7042545742 is a most useful material for showing traces. 7042038757 double line a little above 7042038757 wrist, where 7042038757 typewritist presses against 7042038757 table, was beautifully defined. 7042038757 sewing-machine, 7042496517 7042038757 hand type, leaves a similar mark, but only on 7042038757 left arm, 7042860694 on 7042038757 side 7042496517 it farthest from 7042038757 thumb, instead 7042496517 being right across 7042038757 broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, 7042860694, observing 7042038757 dint 7042496517 a pince-nez at either side 7042496517 her nose, I ventured a remark upon short sight 7042860694 typewriting, 7042545742 seemed to surprise her."

"It surprised me."

"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised 7042860694 interested on glancing down to observe that, though 7042038757 boots 7042545742 she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; 7042038757 one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, 7042860694 7042038757 other a plain one. One was buttoned only in 7042038757 two lower buttons out 7042496517 five, 7042860694 7042038757 other at 7042038757 first, third, 7042860694 fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home 7042941055 odd boots, half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."

"7042860694 what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by my friend's incisive reasoning.

"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right glove was torn at 7042038757 forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove 7042860694 finger were stained 7042941055 violet ink. She had written in a hurry 7042860694 dipped her pen too deep. It must 7042147896 been this morning, or 7042038757 mark would not remain clear upon 7042038757 finger. 7042784042 this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me 7042038757 advertised description 7042496517 Mr. Hosmer Angel?"

I held 7042038757 little printed slip to 7042038757 light.

"Missing," it said, "on 7042038757 morning 7042496517 7042038757 fourteenth, a gentleman named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in 7042038757 centre, bushy, black side-whiskers 7042860694 moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity 7042496517 speech. Was dressed, when last seen, in black frock-coat faced 7042941055 silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert chain, 7042860694 grey Harris tweed trousers, 7042941055 brown gaiters over elastic-sided boots. Known to 7042147896 been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--"

"That will do," said Holmes. "As to 7042038757 letters," he continued, glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There is one remarkable point, however, 7042545742 will no doubt strike you."

"They are typewritten," I remarked.

"Not only that, but 7042038757 signature is typewritten. Look at 7042038757 neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at 7042038757 bottom. There is a date, you see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, 7042545742 is rather vague. 7042038757 point about 7042038757 signature is very suggestive--in fact, we may call it conclusive."

"7042496517 what?"

"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon 7042038757 case?"

"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach 7042496517 promise were instituted."

"No, that was not 7042038757 point. However, I shall write two letters, 7042545742 should settle 7042038757 matter. One is to a firm in 7042038757 City, 7042038757 other is to 7042038757 young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock to-morrow evening. It is just as well that we should do business 7042941055 7042038757 male relatives. 7042860694 now, Doctor, we can do nothing until 7042038757 answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem upon 7042038757 shelf for 7042038757 interim."

I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers 7042496517 reasoning 7042860694 extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must 7042147896 some solid grounds for 7042038757 assured 7042860694 easy demeanour 7042941055 7042545742 he treated 7042038757 singular mystery 7042545742 he had been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in 7042038757 case 7042496517 7042038757 King 7042496517 Bohemia 7042860694 7042496517 7042038757 Irene Adler photograph; but when I looked back to 7042038757 weird business 7042496517 7042038757 Sign 7042496517 Four, 7042860694 7042038757 extraordinary circumstances connected 7042941055 7042038757 Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed 7042545742 he could not unravel.

I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, 7042941055 7042038757 conviction that when I came again on 7042038757 next evening I would find that he held in his hands 7042784042 7042038757 clues 7042545742 would lead up to 7042038757 identity 7042496517 7042038757 disappearing bridegroom 7042496517 Miss Mary Sutherland.

A professional case 7042496517 great gravity was engaging my own attention at 7042038757 time, 7042860694 7042038757 whole 7042496517 next day I was busy at 7042038757 bedside 7042496517 7042038757 sufferer. It was not until close upon six o'clock that I found myself free 7042860694 was able to spring into a hansom 7042860694 drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at 7042038757 denouement 7042496517 7042038757 little mystery. I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, 7042941055 his long, thin form curled up in 7042038757 recesses 7042496517 his armchair. A formidable array 7042496517 bottles 7042860694 test-tubes, 7042941055 7042038757 pungent cleanly smell 7042496517 hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in 7042038757 chemical work 7042545742 was so dear to him.

"Well, 7042147896 you solved it?" I asked as I entered.

"Yes. It was 7042038757 bisulphate 7042496517 baryta."

"No, no, 7042038757 mystery!" I cried.

"Oh, that! I thought 7042496517 7042038757 salt that I 7042147896 been working upon. There was never any mystery in 7042038757 matter, though, as I said yesterday, some 7042496517 7042038757 details are 7042496517 interest. 7042038757 only drawback is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch 7042038757 scoundrel."

"Who was he, then, 7042860694 what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland?"

7042038757 question was hardly out 7042496517 my mouth, 7042860694 Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in 7042038757 passage 7042860694 a tap at 7042038757 door.

"This is 7042038757 girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at six. Come in!"

7042038757 7042362761 who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years 7042496517 age, clean-shaven, 7042860694 sallow-skinned, 7042941055 a bland, insinuating manner, 7042860694 a pair 7042496517 wonderfully sharp 7042860694 penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each 7042496517 us, placed his shiny top-hat upon 7042038757 sideboard, 7042860694 7042941055 a slight bow sidled down into 7042038757 nearest chair.

"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that this typewritten letter is from you, in 7042545742 you made an appointment 7042941055 me for six o'clock?"

"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not quite my own master, you 7042622762. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far better not to wash linen 7042496517 7042038757 sort in public. It was quite against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may 7042147896 noticed, 7042860694 she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. 7042496517 course, I did not mind you so much, as you are not connected 7042941055 7042038757 official police, but it is not pleasant to 7042147896 a family misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"

"On 7042038757 contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I 7042147896 every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."

Mr. Windibank gave a violent start 7042860694 dropped his gloves. "I am delighted to hear it," he said.

"It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a 7042362761's handwriting. Unless they are quite new, no two 7042496517 them write exactly alike. Some letters get more worn than others, 7042860694 some wear only on one side. Now, you remark in this note 7042496517 yours, Mr. Windibank, that in every case there is some little slurring over 7042496517 7042038757 'e,' 7042860694 a slight defect in 7042038757 tail 7042496517 7042038757 'r.' There are fourteen other characteristics, but those are 7042038757 more obvious."

"We do 7042784042 our correspondence 7042941055 this machine at 7042038757 office, 7042860694 no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing keenly at Holmes 7042941055 his bright little eyes.

"7042860694 now I will show you what is really a very interesting study, Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think 7042496517 writing another little monograph some 7042496517 these days on 7042038757 typewriter 7042860694 its relation to crime. It is a subject to 7042545742 I 7042147896 devoted some little attention. I 7042147896 here four letters 7042545742 purport to come from 7042038757 missing 7042362761. They are 7042784042 typewritten. In each case, not only are 7042038757 'e's' slurred 7042860694 7042038757 'r's' tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that 7042038757 fourteen other characteristics to 7042545742 I 7042147896 alluded are there as well."

Mr. Windibank sprang out 7042496517 his chair 7042860694 picked up his hat. "I cannot waste time over this sort 7042496517 fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes," he said. "If you can catch 7042038757 7042362761, catch him, 7042860694 let me 7042622762 when you 7042147896 done it."

"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over 7042860694 turning 7042038757 key in 7042038757 door. "I let you 7042622762, then, that I 7042147896 caught him!"

"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips 7042860694 glancing about him like a rat in a trap.

"Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There is no possible getting out 7042496517 it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too transparent, 7042860694 it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's right! Sit down 7042860694 let us talk it over."

Our visitor collapsed into a chair, 7042941055 a ghastly face 7042860694 a glitter 7042496517 moisture on his brow. "It--it's not actionable," he stammered.

"I am very much afraid that it is not. But 7042272895 ourselves, Windibank, it was as cruel 7042860694 selfish 7042860694 heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over 7042038757 course 7042496517 events, 7042860694 you will contradict me if I go wrong."

7042038757 7042362761 sat huddled up in his chair, 7042941055 his head sunk upon his breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up on 7042038757 corner 7042496517 7042038757 mantelpiece 7042860694, leaning back 7042941055 his hands in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.

"7042038757 7042362761 married a woman very much older than himself for her money," said he, "7042860694 he enjoyed 7042038757 use 7042496517 7042038757 money 7042496517 7042038757 daughter as long as she lived 7042941055 them. It was a considerable sum, for people in their position, 7042860694 7042038757 loss 7042496517 it would 7042147896 made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it. 7042038757 daughter was 7042496517 a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate 7042860694 warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that 7042941055 her fair personal advantages, 7042860694 her little income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would mean, 7042496517 course, 7042038757 loss 7042496517 a hundred a year, so what does her stepfather do to prevent it? He takes 7042038757 obvious course 7042496517 keeping her at home 7042860694 forbidding her to seek 7042038757 company 7042496517 people 7042496517 her own age. But soon he found that that would not answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, 7042860694 finally announced her positive intention 7042496517 going to a certain ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. 7042941055 7042038757 connivance 7042860694 assistance 7042496517 his wife he disguised himself, covered those keen eyes 7042941055 tinted glasses, masked 7042038757 face 7042941055 a moustache 7042860694 a pair 7042496517 bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper, 7042860694 doubly secure on account 7042496517 7042038757 girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, 7042860694 keeps off other lovers by making love himself."

"It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We never thought that she would 7042147896 been so carried away."

"Very likely not. However that may be, 7042038757 young lady was very decidedly carried away, 7042860694, having quite made up her mind that her stepfather was in France, 7042038757 suspicion 7042496517 treachery never for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by 7042038757 gentleman's attentions, 7042860694 7042038757 effect was increased by 7042038757 loudly expressed admiration 7042496517 her mother. Then Mr. Angel began to call, for it was obvious that 7042038757 matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There were meetings, 7042860694 an engagement, 7042545742 would finally secure 7042038757 girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. But 7042038757 deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous. 7042038757 thing to do was clearly to bring 7042038757 business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon 7042038757 young lady's mind 7042860694 prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come. Hence those vows 7042496517 fidelity exacted upon a Testament, 7042860694 hence also 7042038757 allusions to a possibility 7042496517 something happening on 7042038757 very morning 7042496517 7042038757 wedding. James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, 7042860694 so uncertain as to his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen to another 7042362761. As far as 7042038757 church door he brought her, 7042860694 then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by 7042038757 old trick 7042496517 stepping in at one door 7042496517 a four-wheeler 7042860694 out at 7042038757 other. I think that was 7042038757 chain 7042496517 events, Mr. Windibank!"

Our visitor had recovered something 7042496517 his assurance while Holmes had been talking, 7042860694 he rose from his chair now 7042941055 a cold sneer upon his pale face.

"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to 7042622762 that it is you who are breaking 7042038757 law now, 7042860694 not me. I 7042147896 done nothing actionable from 7042038757 first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault 7042860694 illegal constraint."

"7042038757 law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking 7042860694 throwing open 7042038757 door, "yet there never was a 7042362761 who deserved punishment more. If 7042038757 young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!" he continued, flushing up at 7042038757 sight 7042496517 7042038757 bitter sneer upon 7042038757 7042362761's face, "it is not part 7042496517 my duties to my client, but here's a hunting crop handy, 7042860694 I think I shall just treat myself to--" He took two swift steps to 7042038757 whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter 7042496517 steps upon 7042038757 stairs, 7042038757 heavy hall door banged, 7042860694 from 7042038757 window we could see Mr. James Windibank running at 7042038757 top 7042496517 his speed down 7042038757 road.

"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he threw himself down into his chair once more. "That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, 7042860694 ends on a gallows. 7042038757 case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid 7042496517 interest."

"I cannot now entirely see 7042784042 7042038757 steps 7042496517 your reasoning," I remarked.

"Well, 7042496517 course it was obvious from 7042038757 first that this Mr. Hosmer Angel must 7042147896 some strong object for his curious conduct, 7042860694 it was equally clear that 7042038757 only 7042362761 who really profited by 7042038757 incident, as far as we could see, was 7042038757 stepfather. Then 7042038757 fact that 7042038757 two men were never together, but that 7042038757 one always appeared when 7042038757 other was away, was suggestive. So were 7042038757 tinted spectacles 7042860694 7042038757 curious voice, 7042545742 both hinted at a disguise, as did 7042038757 bushy whiskers. My suspicions were 7042784042 confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature, 7042545742, 7042496517 course, inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even 7042038757 smallest sample 7042496517 it. You see 7042784042 these isolated facts, together 7042941055 many minor ones, 7042784042 pointed in 7042038757 same direction."

"7042860694 how did you verify them?"

"Having once spotted my 7042362761, it was easy to get corroboration. I knew 7042038757 firm for 7042545742 this 7042362761 worked. Having taken 7042038757 printed description. I eliminated everything from it 7042545742 could be 7042038757 result 7042496517 a disguise--7042038757 whiskers, 7042038757 glasses, 7042038757 voice, 7042860694 I sent it to 7042038757 firm, 7042941055 a request that they would inform me whether it answered to 7042038757 description 7042496517 any 7042496517 their travellers. I had already noticed 7042038757 peculiarities 7042496517 7042038757 typewriter, 7042860694 I wrote to 7042038757 7042362761 himself at his business address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his reply was typewritten 7042860694 revealed 7042038757 same trivial but characteristic defects. 7042038757 same post brought me a letter from Westhouse & Marbank, 7042496517 Fenchurch Street, to say that 7042038757 description tallied in every respect 7042941055 that 7042496517 their employe, James Windibank. Voila tout!"

"7042860694 Miss Sutherland?"

"If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember 7042038757 old Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh 7042038757 tiger cub, 7042860694 danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, 7042860694 as much knowledge 7042496517 7042038757 world."

ADVENTURE IV. 7042038757 BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY


We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife 7042860694 I, when 7042038757 maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes 7042860694 ran in this way:

"7042147896 you a couple 7042496517 days to spare? 7042147896 just been wired for from 7042038757 west 7042496517 England in connection 7042941055 Boscombe Valley tragedy. Shall be glad if you will come 7042941055 me. Air 7042860694 scenery perfect. Leave Paddington by 7042038757 11:15."

"What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me. "Will you go?"

"I really don't 7042622762 what to say. I 7042147896 a fairly long list at present."

"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You 7042147896 been looking a little pale lately. I think that 7042038757 change would do you good, 7042860694 you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."

"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained through one 7042496517 them," I answered. "But if I am to go, I must pack at once, for I 7042147896 only half an hour."

My experience 7042496517 camp life in Afghanistan had at least had 7042038757 effect 7042496517 making me a prompt 7042860694 ready traveller. My wants were few 7042860694 simple, so that in less than 7042038757 time stated I was in a cab 7042941055 my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock Holmes was pacing up 7042860694 down 7042038757 platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter 7042860694 taller by his long grey travelling-cloak 7042860694 close-fitting cloth cap.

"It is really very good 7042496517 you to come, Watson," said he. "It makes a considerable difference to me, having someone 7042941055 me on whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed. If you will keep 7042038757 two corner seats I shall get 7042038757 tickets."

We had 7042038757 carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter 7042496517 papers 7042545742 Holmes had brought 7042941055 him. Among these he rummaged 7042860694 read, 7042941055 intervals 7042496517 note-taking 7042860694 7042496517 meditation, until we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them 7042784042 into a gigantic ball 7042860694 tossed them up onto 7042038757 rack.

"7042147896 you heard anything 7042496517 7042038757 case?" he asked.

"Not a word. I 7042147896 not seen a paper for some days."

"7042038757 London press has not had very full accounts. I 7042147896 just been looking through 7042784042 7042038757 recent papers in order to master 7042038757 particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one 7042496517 those simple cases 7042545742 are so extremely difficult."

"That sounds a little paradoxical."

"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a clue. 7042038757 more featureless 7042860694 commonplace a crime is, 7042038757 more difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they 7042147896 established a very serious case against 7042038757 son 7042496517 7042038757 murdered 7042362761."

"It is a murder, then?"

"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for granted until I 7042147896 7042038757 opportunity 7042496517 looking personally into it. I will explain 7042038757 state 7042496517 things to you, as far as I 7042147896 been able to understand it, in a very few words.

"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire. 7042038757 largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia 7042860694 returned some years ago to 7042038757 old country. One 7042496517 7042038757 farms 7042545742 he held, that 7042496517 Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was also an ex-Australian. 7042038757 men had known each other in 7042038757 colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible. Turner was apparently 7042038757 richer 7042362761, so McCarthy became his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms 7042496517 perfect equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad 7042496517 eighteen, 7042860694 Turner had an only daughter 7042496517 7042038757 same age, but neither 7042496517 them had wives living. They appear to 7042147896 avoided 7042038757 society 7042496517 7042038757 neighbouring English families 7042860694 to 7042147896 led retired lives, though both 7042038757 McCarthys were fond 7042496517 sport 7042860694 were frequently seen at 7042038757 race-meetings 7042496517 7042038757 neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a 7042362761 7042860694 a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at 7042038757 least. That is as much as I 7042147896 been able to gather about 7042038757 families. Now for 7042038757 facts.

"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at Hatherley about three in 7042038757 afternoon 7042860694 walked down to 7042038757 Boscombe Pool, 7042545742 is a small lake formed by 7042038757 spreading out 7042496517 7042038757 stream 7042545742 runs down 7042038757 Boscombe Valley. He had been out 7042941055 his serving-7042362761 in 7042038757 morning at Ross, 7042860694 he had told 7042038757 7042362761 that he must hurry, as he had an appointment 7042496517 importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came back alive.

"From Hatherley Farmhouse to 7042038757 Boscombe Pool is a quarter 7042496517 a mile, 7042860694 two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, 7042860694 7042038757 other was William Crowder, a game-keeper in 7042038757 employ 7042496517 Mr. Turner. Both these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. 7042038757 game-keeper adds that within a few minutes 7042496517 his seeing Mr. McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going 7042038757 same way 7042941055 a gun under his arm. To 7042038757 best 7042496517 his belief, 7042038757 father was actually in sight at 7042038757 time, 7042860694 7042038757 son was following him. He thought no more 7042496517 7042038757 matter until he heard in 7042038757 evening 7042496517 7042038757 tragedy that had occurred.

"7042038757 two McCarthys were seen after 7042038757 time when William Crowder, 7042038757 game-keeper, lost sight 7042496517 them. 7042038757 Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round, 7042941055 just a fringe 7042496517 grass 7042860694 7042496517 reeds round 7042038757 edge. A girl 7042496517 fourteen, Patience Moran, who is 7042038757 daughter 7042496517 7042038757 lodge-keeper 7042496517 7042038757 Boscombe Valley estate, was in one 7042496517 7042038757 woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she saw, at 7042038757 border 7042496517 7042038757 wood 7042860694 close by 7042038757 lake, Mr. McCarthy 7042860694 his son, 7042860694 that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy 7042038757 elder using very strong language to his son, 7042860694 she saw 7042038757 latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away 7042860694 told her mother when she reached home that she had left 7042038757 two McCarthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool, 7042860694 that she was afraid that they were going to fight. She had hardly said 7042038757 words when young Mr. McCarthy came running up to 7042038757 lodge to say that he had found his father dead in 7042038757 wood, 7042860694 to ask for 7042038757 help 7042496517 7042038757 lodge-keeper. He was much excited, without either his gun or his hat, 7042860694 his right hand 7042860694 sleeve were observed to be stained 7042941055 fresh blood. On following him they found 7042038757 dead body stretched out upon 7042038757 grass beside 7042038757 pool. 7042038757 head had been beaten in by repeated blows 7042496517 some heavy 7042860694 blunt weapon. 7042038757 injuries were such as might very well 7042147896 been inflicted by 7042038757 butt-end 7042496517 his son's gun, 7042545742 was found lying on 7042038757 grass within a few paces 7042496517 7042038757 body. Under these circumstances 7042038757 young 7042362761 was instantly arrested, 7042860694 a verdict 7042496517 'wilful murder' having been returned at 7042038757 inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before 7042038757 magistrates at Ross, who 7042147896 referred 7042038757 case to 7042038757 next Assizes. Those are 7042038757 main facts 7042496517 7042038757 case as they came out before 7042038757 coroner 7042860694 7042038757 police-court."

"I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remarked. "If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here."

"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes thoughtfully. "It may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point 7042496517 view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that 7042038757 case looks exceedingly grave against 7042038757 young 7042362761, 7042860694 it is very possible that he is indeed 7042038757 culprit. There are several people in 7042038757 neighbourhood, however, 7042860694 among them Miss Turner, 7042038757 daughter 7042496517 7042038757 neighbouring landowner, who believe in his innocence, 7042860694 who 7042147896 retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect in connection 7042941055 7042038757 Study in Scarlet, to work out 7042038757 case in his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred 7042038757 case to me, 7042860694 hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead 7042496517 quietly digesting their breakfasts at home."

"I am afraid," said I, "that 7042038757 facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out 7042496517 this case."

"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he answered, laughing. "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts 7042545742 may 7042147896 been by no means obvious to Mr. Lestrade. You 7042622762 me too well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means 7042545742 he is quite incapable 7042496517 employing, or even 7042496517 understanding. To take 7042038757 first example to hand, I very clearly perceive that in your bedroom 7042038757 window is upon 7042038757 right-hand side, 7042860694 yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would 7042147896 noted even so self-evident a thing as that."

"How on earth--"

"My dear fellow, I 7042622762 you well. I 7042622762 7042038757 military neatness 7042545742 characterises you. You shave every morning, 7042860694 in this season you shave by 7042038757 sunlight; but since your shaving is less 7042860694 less complete as we get farther back on 7042038757 left side, until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round 7042038757 angle 7042496517 7042038757 jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated than 7042038757 other. I could not imagine a 7042362761 7042496517 your habits looking at himself in an equal light 7042860694 being satisfied 7042941055 such a result. I only quote this as a trivial example 7042496517 observation 7042860694 inference. Therein lies my metier, 7042860694 it is just possible that it may be 7042496517 some service in 7042038757 investigation 7042545742 lies before us. There are one or two minor points 7042545742 were brought out in 7042038757 inquest, 7042860694 7042545742 are worth considering."

"What are they?"

"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after 7042038757 return to Hatherley Farm. On 7042038757 inspector 7042496517 constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it, 7042860694 that it was no more than his deserts. This observation 7042496517 his had 7042038757 natural effect 7042496517 removing any traces 7042496517 doubt 7042545742 might 7042147896 remained in 7042038757 minds 7042496517 7042038757 coroner's jury."

"It was a confession," I ejaculated.

"No, for it was followed by a protestation 7042496517 innocence."

"Coming on 7042038757 top 7042496517 such a damning series 7042496517 events, it was at least a most suspicious remark."

"On 7042038757 contrary," said Holmes, "it is 7042038757 brightest rift 7042545742 I can at present see in 7042038757 clouds. However innocent he might be, he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that 7042038757 circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I should 7042147896 looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural under 7042038757 circumstances, 7042860694 yet might appear to be 7042038757 best policy to a scheming 7042362761. His frank acceptance 7042496517 7042038757 situation marks him as either an innocent 7042362761, or else as a 7042362761 7042496517 considerable self-restraint 7042860694 firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside 7042038757 dead body 7042496517 his father, 7042860694 that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words 7042941055 him, 7042860694 even, according to 7042038757 little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. 7042038757 self-reproach 7042860694 contrition 7042545742 are displayed in his remark appear to me to be 7042038757 signs 7042496517 a healthy mind rather than 7042496517 a guilty one."

I shook my head. "Many men 7042147896 been hanged on far slighter evidence," I remarked.

"So they 7042147896. 7042860694 many men 7042147896 been wrongfully hanged."

"What is 7042038757 young 7042362761's own account 7042496517 7042038757 matter?"

"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though there are one or two points in it 7042545742 are suggestive. You will find it here, 7042860694 may read it for yourself."

He picked out from his bundle a copy 7042496517 7042038757 local Herefordshire paper, 7042860694 having turned down 7042038757 sheet he pointed out 7042038757 paragraph in 7042545742 7042038757 unfortunate young 7042362761 had given his own statement 7042496517 what had occurred. I settled myself down in 7042038757 corner 7042496517 7042038757 carriage 7042860694 read it very carefully. It ran in this way:

"Mr. James McCarthy, 7042038757 only son 7042496517 7042038757 deceased, was then called 7042860694 gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for three days at Bristol, 7042860694 had only just returned upon 7042038757 morning 7042496517 last Monday, 7042038757 3rd. My father was absent from home at 7042038757 time 7042496517 my arrival, 7042860694 I was informed by 7042038757 maid that he had driven over to Ross 7042941055 John Cobb, 7042038757 groom. Shortly after my return I heard 7042038757 wheels 7042496517 his trap in 7042038757 yard, 7042860694, looking out 7042496517 my window, I saw him get out 7042860694 walk rapidly out 7042496517 7042038757 yard, though I was not aware in 7042545742 direction he was going. I then took my gun 7042860694 strolled out in 7042038757 direction 7042496517 7042038757 Boscombe Pool, 7042941055 7042038757 intention 7042496517 visiting 7042038757 rabbit warren 7042545742 is upon 7042038757 other side. On my way I saw William Crowder, 7042038757 game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had no idea that he was in front 7042496517 me. When about a hundred yards from 7042038757 pool I heard a cry 7042496517 "Cooee!" 7042545742 was a usual signal 7042272895 my father 7042860694 myself. I then hurried forward, 7042860694 found him standing by 7042038757 pool. He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me 7042860694 asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A conversation ensued 7042545742 led to high words 7042860694 almost to blows, for my father was a 7042362761 7042496517 a very violent temper. Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him 7042860694 returned towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, 7042545742 caused me to run back again. I found my father expiring upon 7042038757 ground, 7042941055 his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun 7042860694 held him in my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for some minutes, 7042860694 then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper, his house being 7042038757 nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one near my father when I returned, 7042860694 I 7042147896 no idea how he came by his injuries. He was not a popular 7042362761, being somewhat cold 7042860694 forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I 7042622762, no active enemies. I 7042622762 nothing further 7042496517 7042038757 matter.'

"7042038757 Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before he died?

"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some allusion to a rat.

"7042038757 Coroner: What did you understand by that?

"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was delirious.

"7042038757 Coroner: What was 7042038757 point upon 7042545742 you 7042860694 your father had this final quarrel?

"Witness: I should prefer not to answer.

"7042038757 Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.

"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can assure you that it has nothing to do 7042941055 7042038757 sad tragedy 7042545742 followed.

"7042038757 Coroner: That is for 7042038757 court to decide. I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings 7042545742 may arise.

"Witness: I must still refuse.

"7042038757 Coroner: I understand that 7042038757 cry 7042496517 'Cooee' was a common signal 7042272895 you 7042860694 your father?

"Witness: It was.

"7042038757 Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you, 7042860694 before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?

"Witness (7042941055 considerable confusion): I do not 7042622762.

"A Juryman: Did you see nothing 7042545742 aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing 7042038757 cry 7042860694 found your father fatally injured?

"Witness: Nothing definite.

"7042038757 Coroner: What do you mean?

"Witness: I was so disturbed 7042860694 excited as I rushed out into 7042038757 open, that I could think 7042496517 nothing except 7042496517 my father. Yet I 7042147896 a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon 7042038757 ground to 7042038757 left 7042496517 me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat 7042496517 some sort, or a plaid perhaps. When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was gone.

" 'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?'

" 'Yes, it was gone.'

" 'You cannot say what it was?'

" 'No, I had a feeling something was there.'

" 'How far from 7042038757 body?'

" 'A dozen yards or so.'

" '7042860694 how far from 7042038757 edge 7042496517 7042038757 wood?'

" 'About 7042038757 same.'

" 'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards 7042496517 it?'

" 'Yes, but 7042941055 my back towards it.'

"This concluded 7042038757 examination 7042496517 7042038757 witness."

"I see," said I as I glanced down 7042038757 column, "that 7042038757 coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy. He calls attention, 7042860694 7042941055 reason, to 7042038757 discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details 7042496517 his conversation 7042941055 his father, 7042860694 his singular account 7042496517 his father's dying words. They are 7042784042, as he remarks, very much against 7042038757 son."

Holmes laughed softly to himself 7042860694 stretched himself out upon 7042038757 cushioned seat. "Both you 7042860694 7042038757 coroner 7042147896 been at some pains," said he, "to single out 7042038757 very strongest points in 7042038757 young 7042362761's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination 7042860694 too little? Too little, if he could not invent a cause 7042496517 quarrel 7042545742 would give him 7042038757 sympathy 7042496517 7042038757 jury; too much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so outre as a dying reference to a rat, 7042860694 7042038757 incident 7042496517 7042038757 vanishing cloth. No, sir, I shall approach this case from 7042038757 point 7042496517 view that what this young 7042362761 says is true, 7042860694 we shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us. 7042860694 now here is my pocket Petrarch, 7042860694 not another word shall I say 7042496517 this case until we are on 7042038757 scene 7042496517 action. We lunch at Swindon, 7042860694 I see that we shall be there in twenty minutes."

It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through 7042038757 beautiful Stroud Valley, 7042860694 over 7042038757 broad gleaming Severn, found ourselves at 7042038757 pretty little country-town 7042496517 Ross. A lean, ferret-like 7042362761, furtive 7042860694 sly-looking, was waiting for us upon 7042038757 platform. In spite 7042496517 7042038757 light brown dustcoat 7042860694 leather-leggings 7042545742 he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, 7042496517 Scotland Yard. 7042941055 him we drove to 7042038757 Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us.

"I 7042147896 ordered a carriage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup 7042496517 tea. "I knew your energetic nature, 7042860694 that you would not be happy until you had been on 7042038757 scene 7042496517 7042038757 crime."

"It was very nice 7042860694 complimentary 7042496517 you," Holmes answered. "It is entirely a question 7042496517 barometric pressure."

Lestrade looked startled. "I do not quite follow," he said.

"How is 7042038757 glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, 7042860694 not a cloud in 7042038757 sky. I 7042147896 a caseful 7042496517 cigarettes here 7042545742 need smoking, 7042860694 7042038757 sofa is very much superior to 7042038757 usual country hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I shall use 7042038757 carriage to-night."

Lestrade laughed indulgently. "You 7042147896, no doubt, already formed your conclusions from 7042038757 newspapers," he said. "7042038757 case is as plain as a pikestaff, 7042860694 7042038757 more one goes into it 7042038757 plainer it becomes. Still, 7042496517 course, one can't refuse a lady, 7042860694 such a very positive one, too. She has heard 7042496517 you, 7042860694 would 7042147896 your opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing 7042545742 you could do 7042545742 I had not already done. Why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at 7042038757 door."

He had hardly spoken before there rushed into 7042038757 room one 7042496517 7042038757 most lovely young women that I 7042147896 ever seen in my life. Her violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, 7042784042 thought 7042496517 her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement 7042860694 concern.

"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to 7042038757 other 7042496517 us, 7042860694 finally, 7042941055 a woman's quick intuition, fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you 7042147896 come. I 7042147896 driven down to tell you so. I 7042622762 that James didn't do it. I 7042622762 it, 7042860694 I want you to start upon your work knowing it, too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We 7042147896 known each other since we were little children, 7042860694 I 7042622762 his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."

"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes. "You may rely upon my doing 7042784042 that I can."

"But you 7042147896 read 7042038757 evidence. You 7042147896 formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself think that he is innocent?"

"I think that it is very probable."

"There, now!" she cried, throwing back her head 7042860694 looking defiantly at Lestrade. "You hear! He gives me hopes."

Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions," he said.

"But he is right. Oh! I 7042622762 that he is right. James never did it. 7042860694 about his quarrel 7042941055 his father, I am sure that 7042038757 reason why he would not speak about it to 7042038757 coroner was because I was concerned in it."

"In what way?" asked Holmes.

"It is no time for me to hide anything. James 7042860694 his father had many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage 7042272895 us. James 7042860694 I 7042147896 always loved each other as brother 7042860694 sister; but 7042496517 course he is young 7042860694 has seen very little 7042496517 life yet, 7042860694--7042860694--well, he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there were quarrels, 7042860694 this, I am sure, was one 7042496517 them."

"7042860694 your father?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour 7042496517 such a union?"

"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour 7042496517 it." A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as Holmes shot one 7042496517 his keen, questioning glances at her.

"Thank you for this information," said he. "May I see your father if I call to-morrow?"

"I am afraid 7042038757 doctor won't allow it."

"7042038757 doctor?"

"Yes, 7042147896 you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken to his bed, 7042860694 Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck 7042860694 that his nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was 7042038757 only 7042362761 alive who had known dad in 7042038757 old days in Victoria."

"Ha! In Victoria! That is important."

"Yes, at 7042038757 mines."

"Quite so; at 7042038757 gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner made his money."

"Yes, certainly."

"Thank you, Miss Turner. You 7042147896 been 7042496517 material assistance to me."

"You will tell me if you 7042147896 any news to-morrow. No doubt you will go to 7042038757 prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I 7042622762 him to be innocent."

"I will, Miss Turner."

"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, 7042860694 he misses me so if I leave him. Good-bye, 7042860694 God help you in your undertaking." She hurried from 7042038757 room as impulsively as she had entered, 7042860694 we heard 7042038757 wheels 7042496517 her carriage rattle off down 7042038757 street.

"I am ashamed 7042496517 you, Holmes," said Lestrade 7042941055 dignity after a few minutes' silence. "Why should you raise up hopes 7042545742 you are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender 7042496517 heart, but I call it cruel."

"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy," said Holmes. "7042147896 you an order to see him in prison?"

"Yes, but only for you 7042860694 me."

"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We 7042147896 still time to take a train to Hereford 7042860694 see him to-night?"

"Ample."

"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very slow, but I shall only be away a couple 7042496517 hours."

I walked down to 7042038757 station 7042941055 them, 7042860694 then wandered through 7042038757 streets 7042496517 7042038757 little town, finally returning to 7042038757 hotel, where I lay upon 7042038757 sofa 7042860694 tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel. 7042038757 puny plot 7042496517 7042038757 story was so thin, however, when compared to 7042038757 deep mystery through 7042545742 we were groping, 7042860694 I found my attention wander so continually from 7042038757 action to 7042038757 fact, that I at last flung it across 7042038757 room 7042860694 gave myself up entirely to a consideration 7042496517 7042038757 events 7042496517 7042038757 day. Supposing that this unhappy young 7042362761's story were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely unforeseen 7042860694 extraordinary calamity could 7042147896 occurred 7042272895 7042038757 time when he parted from his father, 7042860694 7042038757 moment when, drawn back by his screams, he rushed into 7042038757 glade? It was something terrible 7042860694 deadly. What could it be? Might not 7042038757 nature 7042496517 7042038757 injuries reveal something to my medical instincts? I rang 7042038757 bell 7042860694 called for 7042038757 weekly county paper, 7042545742 contained a verbatim account 7042496517 7042038757 inquest. In 7042038757 surgeon's deposition it was stated that 7042038757 posterior third 7042496517 7042038757 left parietal bone 7042860694 7042038757 left half 7042496517 7042038757 occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked 7042038757 spot upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must 7042147896 been struck from behind. That was to some extent in favour 7042496517 7042038757 accused, as when seen quarrelling he was face to face 7042941055 his father. Still, it did not go for very much, for 7042038757 older 7042362761 might 7042147896 turned his back before 7042038757 blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call Holmes' attention to it. Then there was 7042038757 peculiar dying reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be delirium. A 7042362761 dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. 7042860694 then 7042038757 incident 7042496517 7042038757 grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true 7042038757 murderer must 7042147896 dropped some part 7042496517 his dress, presumably his overcoat, in his flight, 7042860694 must 7042147896 had 7042038757 hardihood to return 7042860694 to carry it away at 7042038757 instant when 7042038757 son was kneeling 7042941055 his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a tissue 7042496517 mysteries 7042860694 improbabilities 7042038757 whole thing was! I did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, 7042860694 yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction 7042496517 young McCarthy's innocence.

It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone, for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in 7042038757 town.

"7042038757 glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down. "It is 7042496517 importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over 7042038757 ground. On 7042038757 other hand, a 7042362761 should be at his very best 7042860694 keenest for such nice work as that, 7042860694 I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I 7042147896 seen young McCarthy."

"7042860694 what did you learn from him?"

"Nothing."

"Could he throw no light?"

"None at 7042784042. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it 7042860694 was screening him or her, but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very quick-witted youth, though comely to look at 7042860694, I should think, sound at heart."

"I cannot admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage 7042941055 so charming a young lady as this Miss Turner."

"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly, insanely, in love 7042941055 her, but some two years ago, when he was only a lad, 7042860694 before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at a boarding-school, what does 7042038757 idiot do but get into 7042038757 clutches 7042496517 a barmaid in Bristol 7042860694 marry her at a registry office? No one knows a word 7042496517 7042038757 matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy 7042496517 this sort 7042545742 made him throw his hands up into 7042038757 air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner. On 7042038757 other hand, he had no means 7042496517 supporting himself, 7042860694 his father, who was by 7042784042 accounts a very hard 7042362761, would 7042147896 thrown him over utterly had he known 7042038757 truth. It was 7042941055 his barmaid wife that he had spent 7042038757 last three days in Bristol, 7042860694 his father did not 7042622762 where he was. Mark that point. It is 7042496517 importance. Good has come out 7042496517 evil, however, for 7042038757 barmaid, finding from 7042038757 papers that he is in serious trouble 7042860694 likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly 7042860694 has written to him to say that she has a husband already in 7042038757 Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie 7042272895 them. I think that that bit 7042496517 news has consoled young McCarthy for 7042784042 that he has suffered."

"But if he is innocent, who has done it?"

"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two points. One is that 7042038757 murdered 7042362761 had an appointment 7042941055 someone at 7042038757 pool, 7042860694 that 7042038757 someone could not 7042147896 been his son, for his son was away, 7042860694 he did not 7042622762 when he would return. 7042038757 second is that 7042038757 murdered 7042362761 was heard to cry 'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are 7042038757 crucial points upon 7042545742 7042038757 case depends. 7042860694 now let us talk about George Meredith, if you please, 7042860694 we shall leave 7042784042 minor matters until to-morrow."

There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, 7042860694 7042038757 morning broke bright 7042860694 cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us 7042941055 7042038757 carriage, 7042860694 we set off for Hatherley Farm 7042860694 7042038757 Boscombe Pool.

"There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is said that Mr. Turner, 7042496517 7042038757 Hall, is so ill that his life is despaired 7042496517."

"An elderly 7042362761, I presume?" said Holmes.

"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad, 7042860694 he has been in failing health for some time. This business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend 7042496517 McCarthy's, 7042860694, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I 7042147896 learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free."

"Indeed! That is interesting," said Holmes.

"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here speaks 7042496517 his kindness to him."

"Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to 7042147896 had little 7042496517 his own, 7042860694 to 7042147896 been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk 7042496517 marrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to 7042038757 estate, 7042860694 that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case 7042496517 a proposal 7042860694 7042784042 else would follow? It is 7042038757 more strange, since we 7042622762 that Turner himself was averse to 7042038757 idea. 7042038757 daughter told us as much. Do you not deduce something from that?"

"We 7042147896 got to 7042038757 deductions 7042860694 7042038757 inferences," said Lestrade, winking at me. "I find it hard enough to tackle facts, Holmes, without flying away after theories 7042860694 fancies."

"You are right," said Holmes demurely; "you do find it very hard to tackle 7042038757 facts."

"Anyhow, I 7042147896 grasped one fact 7042545742 you seem to find it difficult to get hold 7042496517," replied Lestrade 7042941055 some warmth.

"7042860694 that is--"

"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior 7042860694 that 7042784042 theories to 7042038757 contrary are 7042038757 merest moonshine."

"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog," said Holmes, laughing. "But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley Farm upon 7042038757 left."

"Yes, that is it." It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, 7042941055 great yellow blotches 7042496517 lichen upon 7042038757 grey walls. 7042038757 drawn blinds 7042860694 7042038757 smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though 7042038757 weight 7042496517 this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at 7042038757 door, when 7042038757 maid, at Holmes' request, showed us 7042038757 boots 7042545742 her master wore at 7042038757 time 7042496517 his death, 7042860694 also a pair 7042496517 7042038757 son's, though not 7042038757 pair 7042545742 he had then had. Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to 7042038757 court-yard, from 7042545742 we 7042784042 followed 7042038757 winding track 7042545742 led to Boscombe Pool.

Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this. Men who had only known 7042038757 quiet thinker 7042860694 logician 7042496517 Baker Street would 7042147896 failed to recognise him. His face flushed 7042860694 darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his eyes shone out from beneath them 7042941055 a steely glitter. His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, 7042860694 7042038757 veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate 7042941055 a purely animal lust for 7042038757 chase, 7042860694 his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon 7042038757 matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at 7042038757 most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly 7042860694 silently he made his way along 7042038757 track 7042545742 ran through 7042038757 meadows, 7042860694 so by way 7042496517 7042038757 woods to 7042038757 Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is 7042784042 that district, 7042860694 there were marks 7042496517 many feet, both upon 7042038757 path 7042860694 amid 7042038757 short grass 7042545742 bounded it on either side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, 7042860694 once he made quite a little detour into 7042038757 meadow. Lestrade 7042860694 I walked behind him, 7042038757 detective indifferent 7042860694 contemptuous, while I watched my friend 7042941055 7042038757 interest 7042545742 sprang from 7042038757 conviction that every one 7042496517 his actions was directed towards a definite end.

7042038757 Boscombe Pool, 7042545742 is a little reed-girt sheet 7042496517 water some fifty yards across, is situated at 7042038757 boundary 7042272895 7042038757 Hatherley Farm 7042860694 7042038757 private park 7042496517 7042038757 wealthy Mr. Turner. Above 7042038757 woods 7042545742 lined it upon 7042038757 farther side we could see 7042038757 red, jutting pinnacles 7042545742 marked 7042038757 site 7042496517 7042038757 rich landowner's dwelling. On 7042038757 Hatherley side 7042496517 7042038757 pool 7042038757 woods grew very thick, 7042860694 there was a narrow belt 7042496517 sodden grass twenty paces across 7042272895 7042038757 edge 7042496517 7042038757 trees 7042860694 7042038757 reeds 7042545742 lined 7042038757 lake. Lestrade showed us 7042038757 exact spot at 7042545742 7042038757 body had been found, 7042860694, indeed, so moist was 7042038757 ground, that I could plainly see 7042038757 traces 7042545742 had been left by 7042038757 fall 7042496517 7042038757 stricken 7042362761. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager face 7042860694 peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon 7042038757 trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, 7042860694 then turned upon my companion.

"What did you go into 7042038757 pool for?" he asked.

"I fished about 7042941055 a rake. I thought there might be some weapon or other trace. But how on earth--"

"Oh, tut, tut! I 7042147896 no time! That left foot 7042496517 yours 7042941055 its inward twist is 7042784042 over 7042038757 place. A mole could trace it, 7042860694 there it vanishes among 7042038757 reeds. Oh, how simple it would 7042784042 7042147896 been had I been here before they came like a herd 7042496517 buffalo 7042860694 wallowed 7042784042 over it. Here is where 7042038757 party 7042941055 7042038757 lodge-keeper came, 7042860694 they 7042147896 covered 7042784042 tracks for six or eight feet round 7042038757 body. But here are three separate tracks 7042496517 7042038757 same feet." He drew out a lens 7042860694 lay down upon his waterproof to 7042147896 a better view, talking 7042784042 7042038757 time rather to himself than to us. "These are young McCarthy's feet. Twice he was walking, 7042860694 once he ran swiftly, so that 7042038757 soles are deeply marked 7042860694 7042038757 heels hardly visible. That bears out his story. He ran when he saw his father on 7042038757 ground. Then here are 7042038757 father's feet as he paced up 7042860694 down. What is this, then? It is 7042038757 butt-end 7042496517 7042038757 gun as 7042038757 son stood listening. 7042860694 this? Ha, ha! What 7042147896 we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--7042496517 course that was for 7042038757 cloak. Now where did they come from?" He ran up 7042860694 down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding 7042038757 track until we were well within 7042038757 edge 7042496517 7042038757 wood 7042860694 under 7042038757 shadow 7042496517 a great beech, 7042038757 largest tree in 7042038757 neighbourhood. Holmes traced his way to 7042038757 farther side 7042496517 this 7042860694 lay down once more upon his face 7042941055 a little cry 7042496517 satisfaction. For a long time he remained there, turning over 7042038757 leaves 7042860694 dried sticks, gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope 7042860694 examining 7042941055 his lens not only 7042038757 ground but even 7042038757 bark 7042496517 7042038757 tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among 7042038757 moss, 7042860694 this also he carefully examined 7042860694 retained. Then he followed a pathway through 7042038757 wood until he came to 7042038757 highroad, where 7042784042 traces were lost.

"It has been a case 7042496517 considerable interest," he remarked, returning to his natural manner. "I fancy that this grey house on 7042038757 right must be 7042038757 lodge. I think that I will go in 7042860694 7042147896 a word 7042941055 Moran, 7042860694 perhaps write a little note. Having done that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to 7042038757 cab, 7042860694 I shall be 7042941055 you presently."

It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab 7042860694 drove back into Ross, Holmes still carrying 7042941055 him 7042038757 stone 7042545742 he had picked up in 7042038757 wood.

"This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out. "7042038757 murder was done 7042941055 it."

"I see no marks."

"There are none."

"How do you 7042622762, then?"

"7042038757 grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few days. There was no sign 7042496517 a place whence it had been taken. It corresponds 7042941055 7042038757 injuries. There is no sign 7042496517 any other weapon."

"7042860694 7042038757 murderer?"

"Is a tall 7042362761, left-handed, limps 7042941055 7042038757 right leg, wears thick-soled shooting-boots 7042860694 a grey cloak, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar-holder, 7042860694 carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search."

Lestrade laughed. "I am afraid that I am still a sceptic," he said. "Theories are 7042784042 very well, but we 7042147896 to deal 7042941055 a hard-headed British jury."

"Nous verrons," answered Holmes calmly. "You work your own method, 7042860694 I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon, 7042860694 shall probably return to London by 7042038757 evening train."

"7042860694 leave your case unfinished?"

"No, finished."

"But 7042038757 mystery?"

"It is solved."

"Who was 7042038757 criminal, then?"

"7042038757 gentleman I describe."

"But who is he?"

"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a populous neighbourhood."

Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am a practical 7042362761," he said, "7042860694 I really cannot undertake to go about 7042038757 country looking for a left-handed gentleman 7042941055 a game leg. I should become 7042038757 laughing-stock 7042496517 Scotland Yard."

"7042784042 right," said Holmes quietly. "I 7042147896 given you 7042038757 chance. Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before I leave."

Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon 7042038757 table. Holmes was silent 7042860694 buried in thought 7042941055 a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.

"Look here, Watson," he said when 7042038757 cloth was cleared "just sit down in this chair 7042860694 let me preach to you for a little. I don't 7042622762 quite what to do, 7042860694 I should value your advice. Light a cigar 7042860694 let me expound."

"Pray do so."

"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young McCarthy's narrative 7042545742 struck us both instantly, although they impressed me in his favour 7042860694 you against him. One was 7042038757 fact that his father should, according to his account, cry 'Cooee!' before seeing him. 7042038757 other was his singular dying reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but that was 7042784042 that caught 7042038757 son's ear. Now from this double point our research must commence, 7042860694 we will begin it by presuming that what 7042038757 lad says is absolutely true."

"What 7042496517 this 'Cooee!' then?"

"Well, obviously it could not 7042147896 been meant for 7042038757 son. 7042038757 son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that he was within earshot. 7042038757 'Cooee!' was meant to attract 7042038757 attention 7042496517 whoever it was that he had 7042038757 appointment 7042941055. But 'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry, 7042860694 one 7042545742 is used 7042272895 Australians. There is a strong presumption that 7042038757 person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia."

"What 7042496517 7042038757 rat, then?"

Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket 7042860694 flattened it out on 7042038757 table. "This is a map 7042496517 7042038757 Colony 7042496517 Victoria," he said. "I wired to Bristol for it last night." He put his hand over part 7042496517 7042038757 map. "What do you read?"

"ARAT," I read.

"7042860694 now?" He raised his hand.

"BALLARAT."

"Quite so. That was 7042038757 word 7042038757 7042362761 uttered, 7042860694 7042496517 7042545742 his son only caught 7042038757 last two syllables. He was trying to utter 7042038757 name 7042496517 his murderer. So 7042860694 so, 7042496517 Ballarat."

"It is wonderful!" I exclaimed.

"It is obvious. 7042860694 now, you see, I had narrowed 7042038757 field down considerably. 7042038757 possession 7042496517 a grey garment was a third point 7042545742, granting 7042038757 son's statement to be correct, was a certainty. We 7042147896 come now out 7042496517 mere vagueness to 7042038757 definite conception 7042496517 an Australian from Ballarat 7042941055 a grey cloak."

"Certainly."

"7042860694 one who was at home in 7042038757 district, for 7042038757 pool can only be approached by 7042038757 farm or by 7042038757 estate, where strangers could hardly wander."

"Quite so."

"Then comes our expedition 7042496517 to-day. By an examination 7042496517 7042038757 ground I gained 7042038757 trifling details 7042545742 I gave to that imbecile Lestrade, as to 7042038757 personality 7042496517 7042038757 criminal."

"But how did you gain them?"

"You 7042622762 my method. It is founded upon 7042038757 observation 7042496517 trifles."

"His height I 7042622762 that you might roughly judge from 7042038757 length 7042496517 his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces."

"Yes, they were peculiar boots."

"But his lameness?"

"7042038757 impression 7042496517 his right foot was always less distinct than his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he was lame."

"But his left-handedness."

"You were yourself struck by 7042038757 nature 7042496517 7042038757 injury as recorded by 7042038757 surgeon at 7042038757 inquest. 7042038757 blow was struck from immediately behind, 7042860694 yet was upon 7042038757 left side. Now, how can that be unless it were by a left-handed 7042362761? He had stood behind that tree during 7042038757 interview 7042272895 7042038757 father 7042860694 son. He had even smoked there. I found 7042038757 ash 7042496517 a cigar, 7042545742 my special knowledge 7042496517 tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar. I 7042147896, as you 7042622762, devoted some attention to this, 7042860694 written a little monograph on 7042038757 ashes 7042496517 140 different varieties 7042496517 pipe, cigar, 7042860694 cigarette tobacco. Having found 7042038757 ash, I then looked round 7042860694 discovered 7042038757 stump among 7042038757 moss where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, 7042496517 7042038757 variety 7042545742 are rolled in Rotterdam."

"7042860694 7042038757 cigar-holder?"

"I could see that 7042038757 end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he used a holder. 7042038757 tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but 7042038757 cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife."

"Holmes," I said, "you 7042147896 drawn a net round this 7042362761 from 7042545742 he cannot escape, 7042860694 you 7042147896 saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut 7042038757 cord 7042545742 was hanging him. I see 7042038757 direction in 7042545742 7042784042 this points. 7042038757 culprit is--"

"Mr. John Turner," cried 7042038757 hotel waiter, opening 7042038757 door 7042496517 our sitting-room, 7042860694 ushering in a visitor.

7042038757 7042362761 who entered was a strange 7042860694 impressive figure. His slow, limping step 7042860694 bowed shoulders gave 7042038757 appearance 7042496517 decrepitude, 7042860694 yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, 7042860694 his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed 7042496517 unusual strength 7042496517 body 7042860694 7042496517 character. His tangled beard, grizzled hair, 7042860694 outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air 7042496517 dignity 7042860694 power to his appearance, but his face was 7042496517 an ashen white, while his lips 7042860694 7042038757 corners 7042496517 his nostrils were tinged 7042941055 a shade 7042496517 blue. It was clear to me at a glance that he was in 7042038757 grip 7042496517 some deadly 7042860694 chronic disease.

"Pray sit down on 7042038757 sofa," said Holmes gently. "You had my note?"

"Yes, 7042038757 lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal."

"I thought people would talk if I went to 7042038757 Hall."

"7042860694 why did you wish to see me?" He looked across at my companion 7042941055 despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.

"Yes," said Holmes, answering 7042038757 look rather than 7042038757 words. "It is so. I 7042622762 7042784042 about McCarthy."

7042038757 old 7042362761 sank his face in his hands. "God help me!" he cried. "But I would not 7042147896 let 7042038757 young 7042362761 come to harm. I give you my word that I would 7042147896 spoken out if it went against him at 7042038757 Assizes."

"I am glad to hear you say so," said Holmes gravely.

"I would 7042147896 spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested."

"It may not come to that," said Holmes.

"What?"

"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here, 7042860694 I am acting in her interests. Young McCarthy must be got off, however."

"I am a dying 7042362761," said old Turner. "I 7042147896 had diabetes for years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol."

Holmes rose 7042860694 sat down at 7042038757 table 7042941055 his pen in his hand 7042860694 a bundle 7042496517 paper before him. "Just tell us 7042038757 truth," he said. "I shall jot down 7042038757 facts. You will sign it, 7042860694 Watson here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at 7042038757 last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall not use it unless it is absolutely needed."

"It's as well," said 7042038757 old 7042362761; "it's a question whether I shall live to 7042038757 Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I should wish to spare Alice 7042038757 shock. 7042860694 now I will make 7042038757 thing clear to you; it has been a long time in 7042038757 acting, but will not take me long to tell.

"You didn't 7042622762 this dead 7042362761, McCarthy. He was a devil incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out 7042496517 7042038757 clutches 7042496517 such a 7042362761 as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years, 7042860694 he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to be in his power.

"It was in 7042038757 early '60's at 7042038757 diggings. I was a young chap then, hot-blooded 7042860694 reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck 7042941055 my claim, took to 7042038757 bush, 7042860694 in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber. There were six 7042496517 us, 7042860694 we had a wild, free life 7042496517 it, sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping 7042038757 wagons on 7042038757 road to 7042038757 diggings. Black Jack 7042496517 Ballarat was 7042038757 name I went under, 7042860694 our party is still remembered in 7042038757 colony as 7042038757 Ballarat Gang.

"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, 7042860694 we lay in wait for it 7042860694 attacked it. There were six troopers 7042860694 six 7042496517 us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four 7042496517 their saddles at 7042038757 first volley. Three 7042496517 our boys were killed, however, before we got 7042038757 swag. I put my pistol to 7042038757 head 7042496517 7042038757 wagon-driver, who was this very 7042362761 McCarthy. I wish to 7042038757 Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every feature. We got away 7042941055 7042038757 gold, became wealthy men, 7042860694 made our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted from my old pals 7042860694 determined to settle down to a quiet 7042860694 respectable life. I bought this estate, 7042545742 chanced to be in 7042038757 market, 7042860694 I set myself to do a little good 7042941055 my money, to make up for 7042038757 way in 7042545742 I had earned it. I married, too, 7042860694 though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice. Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down 7042038757 right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned over a new leaf 7042860694 did my best to make up for 7042038757 past. 7042784042 was going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.

"I had gone up to town about an investment, 7042860694 I met him in Regent Street 7042941055 hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.

" 'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touching me on 7042038757 arm; 'we'll be as good as a family to you. There's two 7042496517 us, me 7042860694 my son, 7042860694 you can 7042147896 7042038757 keeping 7042496517 us. If you don't--it's a fine, law-abiding country is England, 7042860694 there's always a policeman within hail.'

"Well, down they came to 7042038757 west country, there was no shaking them off, 7042860694 there they 7042147896 lived rent free on my best land ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more afraid 7042496517 her knowing my past than 7042496517 7042038757 police. Whatever he wanted he must 7042147896, 7042860694 whatever it was I gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing 7042545742 I could not give. He asked for Alice.

"His son, you see, had grown up, 7042860694 so had my girl, 7042860694 as I was known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into 7042038757 whole property. But there I was firm. I would not 7042147896 his cursed stock mixed 7042941055 mine; not that I had any dislike to 7042038757 lad, but his blood was in him, 7042860694 that was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do his worst. We were to meet at 7042038757 pool midway 7042272895 our houses to talk it over.

"When I went down there I found him talking 7042941055 his son, so I smoked a cigar 7042860694 waited behind a tree until he should be alone. But as I listened to his talk 7042784042 that was black 7042860694 bitter in me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my daughter 7042941055 as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off 7042038757 streets. It drove me mad to think that I 7042860694 7042784042 that I held most dear should be in 7042038757 power 7042496517 such a 7042362761 as this. Could I not snap 7042038757 bond? I was already a dying 7042860694 a desperate 7042362761. Though clear 7042496517 mind 7042860694 fairly strong 7042496517 limb, I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory 7042860694 my girl! Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I 7042147896 sinned, I 7042147896 led a life 7042496517 martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl should be entangled in 7042038757 same meshes 7042545742 held me was more than I could suffer. I struck him down 7042941055 no more compunction than if he had been some foul 7042860694 venomous beast. His cry brought back his son; but I had gained 7042038757 cover 7042496517 7042038757 wood, though I was forced to go back to fetch 7042038757 cloak 7042545742 I had dropped in my flight. That is 7042038757 true story, gentlemen, 7042496517 7042784042 that occurred."

"Well, it is not for me to judge you," said Holmes as 7042038757 old 7042362761 signed 7042038757 statement 7042545742 had been drawn out. "I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation."

"I pray not, sir. 7042860694 what do you intend to do?"

"In view 7042496517 your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you will soon 7042147896 to answer for your deed at a higher court than 7042038757 Assizes. I will keep your confession, 7042860694 if McCarthy is condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; 7042860694 your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe 7042941055 us."

"Farewell, then," said 7042038757 old 7042362761 solemnly. "Your own deathbeds, when they come, will be 7042038757 easier for 7042038757 thought 7042496517 7042038757 peace 7042545742 you 7042147896 given to mine." Tottering 7042860694 shaking in 7042784042 his giant frame, he stumbled slowly from 7042038757 room.

"God help us!" said Holmes after a long silence. "Why does fate play such tricks 7042941055 poor, helpless worms? I never hear 7042496517 such a case as this that I do not think 7042496517 Baxter's words, 7042860694 say, 'There, but for 7042038757 grace 7042496517 God, goes Sherlock Holmes.' "

James McCarthy was acquitted at 7042038757 Assizes on 7042038757 strength 7042496517 a number 7042496517 objections 7042545742 had been drawn out by Holmes 7042860694 submitted to 7042038757 defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; 7042860694 there is every prospect that 7042038757 son 7042860694 daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance 7042496517 7042038757 black cloud 7042545742 rests upon their past.

ADVENTURE  V.  7042038757 FIVE ORANGE PIPS


When I glance over my notes 7042860694 records 7042496517 7042038757 Sherlock Holmes cases 7042272895 7042038757 years '82 7042860694 '90, I am faced by so many 7042545742 present strange 7042860694 interesting features that it is no easy matter to 7042622762 7042545742 to choose 7042860694 7042545742 to leave. Some, however, 7042147896 already gained publicity through 7042038757 papers, 7042860694 others 7042147896 not offered a field for those peculiar qualities 7042545742 my friend possessed in so high a degree, 7042860694 7042545742 it is 7042038757 object 7042496517 these papers to illustrate. Some, too, 7042147896 baffled his analytical skill, 7042860694 would be, as narratives, beginnings without an ending, while others 7042147896 been but partially cleared up, 7042860694 7042147896 their explanations founded rather upon conjecture 7042860694 surmise than on that absolute logical proof 7042545742 was so dear to him. There is, however, one 7042496517 these last 7042545742 was so remarkable in its details 7042860694 so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account 7042496517 it in spite 7042496517 7042038757 fact that there are points in connection 7042941055 it 7042545742 never 7042147896 been, 7042860694 probably never will be, entirely cleared up.

7042038757 year '87 furnished us 7042941055 a long series 7042496517 cases 7042496517 greater or less interest, 7042496517 7042545742 I retain 7042038757 records. Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account 7042496517 7042038757 adventure 7042496517 7042038757 Paradol Chamber, 7042496517 7042038757 Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in 7042038757 lower vault 7042496517 a furniture warehouse, 7042496517 7042038757 facts connected 7042941055 7042038757 loss 7042496517 7042038757 British barque Sophy Anderson, 7042496517 7042038757 singular adventures 7042496517 7042038757 Grice Patersons in 7042038757 island 7042496517 Uffa, 7042860694 finally 7042496517 7042038757 Camberwell poisoning case. In 7042038757 latter, as may be remembered, Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up 7042038757 dead 7042362761's watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, 7042860694 that therefore 7042038757 deceased had gone to bed within that time--a deduction 7042545742 was 7042496517 7042038757 greatest importance in clearing up 7042038757 case. 7042784042 these I may sketch out at some future date, but none 7042496517 them present such singular features as 7042038757 strange train 7042496517 circumstances 7042545742 I 7042147896 now taken up my pen to describe.

It was in 7042038757 latter days 7042496517 September, 7042860694 7042038757 equinoctial gales had set in 7042941055 exceptional violence. 7042784042 day 7042038757 wind had screamed 7042860694 7042038757 rain had beaten against 7042038757 windows, so that even here in 7042038757 heart 7042496517 great, hand-made London we were forced to raise our minds for 7042038757 instant from 7042038757 routine 7042496517 life 7042860694 to recognise 7042038757 presence 7042496517 those great elemental forces 7042545742 shriek at mankind through 7042038757 bars 7042496517 his civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, 7042038757 storm grew higher 7042860694 louder, 7042860694 7042038757 wind cried 7042860694 sobbed like a child in 7042038757 chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side 7042496517 7042038757 fireplace cross-indexing his records 7042496517 crime, while I at 7042038757 other was deep in one 7042496517 Clark Russell's fine sea-stories until 7042038757 howl 7042496517 7042038757 gale from without seemed to blend 7042941055 7042038757 text, 7042860694 7042038757 splash 7042496517 7042038757 rain to lengthen out into 7042038757 long swash 7042496517 7042038757 sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother's, 7042860694 for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker Street.

"Why," said I, glancing up at my companion, "that was surely 7042038757 bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend 7042496517 yours, perhaps?"

"Except yourself I 7042147896 none," he answered. "I do not encourage visitors."

"A client, then?"

"If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a 7042362761 out on such a day 7042860694 at such an hour. But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony 7042496517 7042038757 landlady's."

Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a step in 7042038757 passage 7042860694 a tapping at 7042038757 door. He stretched out his long arm to turn 7042038757 lamp away from himself 7042860694 towards 7042038757 vacant chair upon 7042545742 a newcomer must sit.

"Come in!" said he.

7042038757 7042362761 who entered was young, some two-7042860694-twenty at 7042038757 outside, well-groomed 7042860694 trimly clad, 7042941055 something 7042496517 refinement 7042860694 delicacy in his bearing. 7042038757 streaming umbrella 7042545742 he held in his hand, 7042860694 his long shining waterproof told 7042496517 7042038757 fierce weather through 7042545742 he had come. He looked about him anxiously in 7042038757 glare 7042496517 7042038757 lamp, 7042860694 I could see that his face was pale 7042860694 his eyes heavy, like those 7042496517 a 7042362761 who is weighed down 7042941055 some great anxiety.

"I owe you an apology," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes. "I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I 7042147896 brought some traces 7042496517 7042038757 storm 7042860694 rain into your snug chamber."

"Give me your coat 7042860694 umbrella," said Holmes. "They may rest here on 7042038757 hook 7042860694 will be dry presently. You 7042147896 come up from 7042038757 south-west, I see."

"Yes, from Horsham."

"That clay 7042860694 chalk mixture 7042545742 I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive."

"I 7042147896 come for advice."

"That is easily got."

"7042860694 help."

"That is not always so easy."

"I 7042147896 heard 7042496517 you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in 7042038757 Tankerville Club scandal."

"Ah, 7042496517 course. He was wrongfully accused 7042496517 cheating at cards."

"He said that you could solve anything."

"He said too much."

"That you are never beaten."

"I 7042147896 been beaten four times--three times by men, 7042860694 once by a woman."

"But what is that compared 7042941055 7042038757 number 7042496517 your successes?"

"It is true that I 7042147896 been generally successful."

"Then you may be so 7042941055 me."

"I beg that you will draw your chair up to 7042038757 fire 7042860694 favour me 7042941055 some details as to your case."

"It is no ordinary one."

"None 7042496517 those 7042545742 come to me are. I am 7042038757 last court 7042496517 appeal."

"7042860694 yet I question, sir, whether, in 7042784042 your experience, you 7042147896 ever listened to a more mysterious 7042860694 inexplicable chain 7042496517 events than those 7042545742 7042147896 happened in my own family."

"You fill me 7042941055 interest," said Holmes. "Pray give us 7042038757 essential facts from 7042038757 commencement, 7042860694 I can afterwards question you as to those details 7042545742 seem to me to be most important."

7042038757 young 7042362761 pulled his chair up 7042860694 pushed his wet feet out towards 7042038757 blaze.

"My name," said he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affairs 7042147896, as far as I can understand, little to do 7042941055 this awful business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea 7042496517 7042038757 facts, I must go back to 7042038757 commencement 7042496517 7042038757 affair.

"You must 7042622762 that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias 7042860694 my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry, 7042545742 he enlarged at 7042038757 time 7042496517 7042038757 invention 7042496517 bicycling. He was a patentee 7042496517 7042038757 Openshaw unbreakable tire, 7042860694 his business met 7042941055 such success that he was able to sell it 7042860694 to retire upon a handsome competence.

"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young 7042362761 7042860694 became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to 7042147896 done very well. At 7042038757 time 7042496517 7042038757 war he fought in Jackson's army, 7042860694 afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came back to Europe 7042860694 took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham. He had made a very considerable fortune in 7042038757 States, 7042860694 his reason for leaving them was his aversion to 7042038757 negroes, 7042860694 his dislike 7042496517 7042038757 Republican policy in extending 7042038757 franchise to them. He was a singular 7042362761, fierce 7042860694 quick-tempered, very foul-mouthed when he was angry, 7042860694 7042496517 a most retiring disposition. During 7042784042 7042038757 years that he lived at Horsham, I doubt if ever he set foot in 7042038757 town. He had a garden 7042860694 two or three fields round his house, 7042860694 there he would take his exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. He drank a great deal 7042496517 brandy 7042860694 smoked very heavily, but he would see no society 7042860694 did not want any friends, not even his own brother.

"He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at 7042038757 time when he saw me first I was a youngster 7042496517 twelve or so. This would be in 7042038757 year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in England. He begged my father to let me live 7042941055 him 7042860694 he was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be fond 7042496517 playing backgammon 7042860694 draughts 7042941055 me, 7042860694 he would make me his representative both 7042941055 7042038757 servants 7042860694 7042941055 7042038757 tradespeople, so that by 7042038757 time that I was sixteen I was quite master 7042496517 7042038757 house. I kept 7042784042 7042038757 keys 7042860694 could go where I liked 7042860694 do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he had a single room, a lumber-room up among 7042038757 attics, 7042545742 was invariably locked, 7042860694 7042545742 he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter. 7042941055 a boy's curiosity I 7042147896 peeped through 7042038757 keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a collection 7042496517 old trunks 7042860694 bundles as would be expected in such a room.

"One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter 7042941055 a foreign stamp lay upon 7042038757 table in front 7042496517 7042038757 colonel's plate. It was not a common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were 7042784042 paid in ready money, 7042860694 he had no friends 7042496517 any sort. 'From India!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondicherry postmark! What can this be?' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little dried orange pips, 7042545742 pattered down upon his plate. I began to laugh at this, but 7042038757 laugh was struck from my lips at 7042038757 sight 7042496517 his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his skin 7042038757 colour 7042496517 putty, 7042860694 he glared at 7042038757 envelope 7042545742 he still held in his trembling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, 7042860694 then, 'My God, my God, my sins 7042147896 overtaken me!'

" 'What is it, uncle?' I cried.

" 'Death,' said he, 7042860694 rising from 7042038757 table he retired to his room, leaving me palpitating 7042941055 horror. I took up 7042038757 envelope 7042860694 saw scrawled in red ink upon 7042038757 inner flap, just above 7042038757 gum, 7042038757 letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else save 7042038757 five dried pips. What could be 7042038757 reason 7042496517 his overpowering terror? I left 7042038757 breakfast-table, 7042860694 as I ascended 7042038757 stair I met him coming down 7042941055 an old rusty key, 7042545742 must 7042147896 belonged to 7042038757 attic, in one hand, 7042860694 a small brass box, like a cashbox, in 7042038757 other.

" 'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still,' said he 7042941055 an oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to-day, 7042860694 send down to Fordham, 7042038757 Horsham lawyer.'

"I did as he ordered, 7042860694 when 7042038757 lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to 7042038757 room. 7042038757 fire was burning brightly, 7042860694 in 7042038757 grate there was a mass 7042496517 black, fluffy ashes, as 7042496517 burned paper, while 7042038757 brass box stood open 7042860694 empty beside it. As I glanced at 7042038757 box I noticed, 7042941055 a start, that upon 7042038757 lid was printed 7042038757 treble K 7042545742 I had read in 7042038757 morning upon 7042038757 envelope.

" 'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I leave my estate, 7042941055 7042784042 its advantages 7042860694 7042784042 its disadvantages, to my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well 7042860694 good! If you find you cannot, take my advice, my boy, 7042860694 leave it to your deadliest enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign 7042038757 paper where Mr. Fordham shows you.'

"I signed 7042038757 paper as directed, 7042860694 7042038757 lawyer took it away 7042941055 him. 7042038757 singular incident made, as you may think, 7042038757 deepest impression upon me, 7042860694 I pondered over it 7042860694 turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything 7042496517 it. Yet I could not shake off 7042038757 vague feeling 7042496517 dread 7042545742 it left behind, though 7042038757 sensation grew less keen as 7042038757 weeks passed 7042860694 nothing happened to disturb 7042038757 usual routine 7042496517 our lives. I could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever, 7042860694 he was less inclined for any sort 7042496517 society. Most 7042496517 his time he would spend in his room, 7042941055 7042038757 door locked upon 7042038757 inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort 7042496517 drunken frenzy 7042860694 would burst out 7042496517 7042038757 house 7042860694 tear about 7042038757 garden 7042941055 a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid 7042496517 no 7042362761, 7042860694 that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by 7042362761 or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would rush tumultuously in at 7042038757 door 7042860694 lock 7042860694 bar it behind him, like a 7042362761 who can brazen it out no longer against 7042038757 terror 7042545742 lies at 7042038757 roots 7042496517 his soul. At such times I 7042147896 seen his face, even on a cold day, glisten 7042941055 moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.

"Well, to come to an end 7042496517 7042038757 matter, Mr. Holmes, 7042860694 not to abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one 7042496517 those drunken sallies from 7042545742 he never came back. We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, 7042545742 lay at 7042038757 foot 7042496517 7042038757 garden. There was no sign 7042496517 any violence, 7042860694 7042038757 water was but two feet deep, so that 7042038757 jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict 7042496517 'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced from 7042038757 very thought 7042496517 death, had much ado to persuade myself that he had gone out 7042496517 his way to meet it. 7042038757 matter passed, however, 7042860694 my father entered into possession 7042496517 7042038757 estate, 7042860694 7042496517 some $14,000, 7042545742 lay to his credit at 7042038757 bank."

"One moment," Holmes interposed, "your statement is, I foresee, one 7042496517 7042038757 most remarkable to 7042545742 I 7042147896 ever listened. Let me 7042147896 7042038757 date 7042496517 7042038757 reception by your uncle 7042496517 7042038757 letter, 7042860694 7042038757 date 7042496517 his supposed suicide."

"7042038757 letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks later, upon 7042038757 night 7042496517 May 2nd."

"Thank you. Pray proceed."

"When my father took over 7042038757 Horsham property, he, at my request, made a careful examination 7042496517 7042038757 attic, 7042545742 had been always locked up. We found 7042038757 brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. On 7042038757 inside 7042496517 7042038757 cover was a paper label, 7042941055 7042038757 initials 7042496517 K. K. K. repeated upon it, 7042860694 'Letters, memoranda, receipts, 7042860694 a register' written beneath. These, we presume, indicated 7042038757 nature 7042496517 7042038757 papers 7042545742 had been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For 7042038757 rest, there was nothing 7042496517 much importance in 7042038757 attic save a great many scattered papers 7042860694 note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in America. Some 7042496517 them were 7042496517 7042038757 war time 7042860694 showed that he had done his duty well 7042860694 had borne 7042038757 repute 7042496517 a brave soldier. Others were 7042496517 a date during 7042038757 reconstruction 7042496517 7042038757 Southern states, 7042860694 were mostly concerned 7042941055 politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing 7042038757 carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from 7042038757 North.

"Well, it was 7042038757 beginning 7042496517 '84 when my father came to live at Horsham, 7042860694 7042784042 went as well as possible 7042941055 us until 7042038757 January 7042496517 '85. On 7042038757 fourth day after 7042038757 new year I heard my father give a sharp cry 7042496517 surprise as we sat together at 7042038757 breakfast-table. There he was, sitting 7042941055 a newly opened envelope in one hand 7042860694 five dried orange pips in 7042038757 outstretched palm 7042496517 7042038757 other one. He had always laughed at what he called my cock-7042860694-bull story about 7042038757 colonel, but he looked very scared 7042860694 puzzled now that 7042038757 same thing had come upon himself.

" 'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he stammered.

"My heart had turned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.

"He looked inside 7042038757 envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are 7042038757 very letters. But what is this written above them?'

" 'Put 7042038757 papers on 7042038757 sundial,' I read, peeping over his shoulder.

" 'What papers? What sundial?' he asked.

" '7042038757 sundial in 7042038757 garden. There is no other,' said I; 'but 7042038757 papers must be those that are destroyed.'

" 'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'We are in a civilised land here, 7042860694 we can't 7042147896 tomfoolery 7042496517 this kind. Where does 7042038757 thing come from?'

" 'From Dundee,' I answered, glancing at 7042038757 postmark.

" 'Some preposterous practical joke,' said he. 'What 7042147896 I to do 7042941055 sundials 7042860694 papers? I shall take no notice 7042496517 such nonsense.'

" 'I should certainly speak to 7042038757 police,' I said.

" '7042860694 be laughed at for my pains. Nothing 7042496517 7042038757 sort.'

" 'Then let me do so?'

" 'No, I forbid you. I won't 7042147896 a fuss made about such nonsense.'

"It was in vain to argue 7042941055 him, for he was a very obstinate 7042362761. I went about, however, 7042941055 a heart 7042545742 was full 7042496517 forebodings.

"On 7042038757 third day after 7042038757 coming 7042496517 7042038757 letter my father went from home to visit an old friend 7042496517 his, Major Freebody, who is in command 7042496517 one 7042496517 7042038757 forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in error. Upon 7042038757 second day 7042496517 his absence I received a telegram from 7042038757 major, imploring me to come at once. My father had fallen over one 7042496517 7042038757 deep chalk-pits 7042545742 abound in 7042038757 neighbourhood, 7042860694 was lying senseless, 7042941055 a shattered skull. I hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from Fareham in 7042038757 twilight, 7042860694 as 7042038757 country was unknown to him, 7042860694 7042038757 chalk-pit unfenced, 7042038757 jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict 7042496517 'death from accidental causes.' Carefully as I examined every fact connected 7042941055 his death, I was unable to find anything 7042545742 could suggest 7042038757 idea 7042496517 murder. There were no signs 7042496517 violence, no footmarks, no robbery, no record 7042496517 strangers having been seen upon 7042038757 roads. 7042860694 yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, 7042860694 that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.

"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me why I did not dispose 7042496517 it? I answer, because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle's life, 7042860694 that 7042038757 danger would be as pressing in one house as in another.

"It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, 7042860694 two years 7042860694 eight months 7042147896 elapsed since then. During that time I 7042147896 lived happily at Horsham, 7042860694 I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away from 7042038757 family, 7042860694 that it had ended 7042941055 7042038757 last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning 7042038757 blow fell in 7042038757 very shape in 7042545742 it had come upon my father."

7042038757 young 7042362761 took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, 7042860694 turning to 7042038757 table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.

"This is 7042038757 envelope," he continued. "7042038757 postmark is London--eastern division. Within are 7042038757 very words 7042545742 were upon my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; 7042860694 then 'Put 7042038757 papers on 7042038757 sundial.' "

"What 7042147896 you done?" asked Holmes.

"Nothing."

"Nothing?"

"To tell 7042038757 truth"--he sank his face into his thin, white hands--"I 7042147896 felt helpless. I 7042147896 felt like one 7042496517 those poor rabbits when 7042038757 snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in 7042038757 grasp 7042496517 some resistless, inexorable evil, 7042545742 no foresight 7042860694 no precautions can guard against."

"Tut! tut!" cried Sherlock Holmes. "You must act, 7042362761, or you are lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for despair."

"I 7042147896 seen 7042038757 police."

"Ah!"

"But they listened to my story 7042941055 a smile. I am convinced that 7042038757 inspector has formed 7042038757 opinion that 7042038757 letters are 7042784042 practical jokes, 7042860694 that 7042038757 deaths 7042496517 my relations were really accidents, as 7042038757 jury stated, 7042860694 were not to be connected 7042941055 7042038757 warnings."

Holmes shook his clenched hands in 7042038757 air. "Incredible imbecility!" he cried.

"They 7042147896, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in 7042038757 house 7042941055 me."

"Has he come 7042941055 you to-night?"

"No. His orders were to stay in 7042038757 house."

Again Holmes raved in 7042038757 air.

"Why did you come to me," he cried, "7042860694, above 7042784042, why did you not come at once?"

"I did not 7042622762. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles 7042860694 was advised by him to come to you."

"It is really two days since you had 7042038757 letter. We should 7042147896 acted before this. You 7042147896 no further evidence, I suppose, than that 7042545742 you 7042147896 placed before us--no suggestive detail 7042545742 might help us?"

"There is one thing," said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat pocket, 7042860694, drawing out a piece 7042496517 discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he laid it out upon 7042038757 table. "I 7042147896 some remembrance," said he, "that on 7042038757 day when my uncle burned 7042038757 papers I observed that 7042038757 small, unburned margins 7042545742 lay amid 7042038757 ashes were 7042496517 this particular colour. I found this single sheet upon 7042038757 floor 7042496517 his room, 7042860694 I am inclined to think that it may be one 7042496517 7042038757 papers 7042545742 has, perhaps, fluttered out from among 7042038757 others, 7042860694 in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond 7042038757 mention 7042496517 pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think myself that it is a page from some private diary. 7042038757 writing is undoubtedly my uncle's."

Holmes moved 7042038757 lamp, 7042860694 we both bent over 7042038757 sheet 7042496517 paper, 7042545742 showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. It was headed, "March, 1869," 7042860694 beneath were 7042038757 following enigmatical notices:

"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.

"7th. Set 7042038757 pips on McCauley, Paramore, 7042860694

        John Swain, 7042496517 St. Augustine.

"9th. McCauley cleared.

"10th. John Swain cleared.

"12th. Visited Paramore. 7042784042 well."

"Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up 7042038757 paper 7042860694 returning it to our visitor. "7042860694 now you must on no account lose another instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you 7042147896 told me. You must get home instantly 7042860694 act."

"What shall I do?"

"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must put this piece 7042496517 paper 7042545742 you 7042147896 shown us into 7042038757 brass box 7042545742 you 7042147896 described. You must also put in a note to say that 7042784042 7042038757 other papers were burned by your uncle, 7042860694 that this is 7042038757 only one 7042545742 remains. You must assert that in such words as will carry conviction 7042941055 them. Having done this, you must at once put 7042038757 box out upon 7042038757 sundial, as directed. Do you understand?"

"Entirely."

"Do not think 7042496517 revenge, or anything 7042496517 7042038757 sort, at present. I think that we may gain that by means 7042496517 7042038757 law; but we 7042147896 our web to weave, while theirs is already woven. 7042038757 first consideration is to remove 7042038757 pressing danger 7042545742 threatens you. 7042038757 second is to clear up 7042038757 mystery 7042860694 to punish 7042038757 guilty parties."

"I thank you," said 7042038757 young 7042362761, rising 7042860694 pulling on his overcoat. "You 7042147896 given me fresh life 7042860694 hope. I shall certainly do as you advise."

"Do not lose an instant. 7042860694, above 7042784042, take care 7042496517 yourself in 7042038757 meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real 7042860694 imminent danger. How do you go back?"

"By train from Waterloo."

"It is not yet nine. 7042038757 streets will be crowded, so I trust that you may be in safety. 7042860694 yet you cannot guard yourself too closely."

"I am armed."

"That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case."

"I shall see you at Horsham, then?"

"No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek it."

"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, 7042941055 news as to 7042038757 box 7042860694 7042038757 papers. I shall take your advice in every particular." He shook hands 7042941055 us 7042860694 took his leave. Outside 7042038757 wind still screamed 7042860694 7042038757 rain splashed 7042860694 pattered against 7042038757 windows. This strange, wild story seemed to 7042147896 come to us from amid 7042038757 mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet 7042496517 sea-weed in a gale--7042860694 now to 7042147896 been reabsorbed by them once more.

Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, 7042941055 his head sunk forward 7042860694 his eyes bent upon 7042038757 red glow 7042496517 7042038757 fire. Then he lit his pipe, 7042860694 leaning back in his chair he watched 7042038757 blue smoke-rings as they chased each other up to 7042038757 ceiling.

"I think, Watson," he remarked at last, "that 7042496517 7042784042 our cases we 7042147896 had none more fantastic than this."

"Save, perhaps, 7042038757 Sign 7042496517 Four."

"Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. 7042860694 yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did 7042038757 Sholtos."

"But 7042147896 you," I asked, "formed any definite conception as to what these perils are?"

"There can be no question as to their nature," he answered.

"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., 7042860694 why does he pursue this unhappy family?"

Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes 7042860694 placed his elbows upon 7042038757 arms 7042496517 his chair, 7042941055 his finger-tips together. "7042038757 ideal reasoner," he remarked, "would, when he had once been shown a single fact in 7042784042 its bearings, deduce from it not only 7042784042 7042038757 chain 7042496517 events 7042545742 led up to it but also 7042784042 7042038757 results 7042545742 would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by 7042038757 contemplation 7042496517 a single bone, so 7042038757 observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series 7042496517 incidents should be able to accurately state 7042784042 7042038757 other ones, both before 7042860694 after. We 7042147896 not yet grasped 7042038757 results 7042545742 7042038757 reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in 7042038757 study 7042545742 7042147896 baffled 7042784042 those who 7042147896 sought a solution by 7042038757 aid 7042496517 their senses. To carry 7042038757 art, however, to its highest pitch, it is necessary that 7042038757 reasoner should be able to utilise 7042784042 7042038757 facts 7042545742 7042147896 come to his knowledge; 7042860694 this in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession 7042496517 7042784042 knowledge, 7042545742, even in these days 7042496517 free education 7042860694 encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so impossible, however, that a 7042362761 should possess 7042784042 knowledge 7042545742 is likely to be useful to him in his work, 7042860694 this I 7042147896 endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one occasion, in 7042038757 early days 7042496517 our friendship, defined my limits in a very precise fashion."

"Yes," I answered, laughing. "It was a singular document. Philosophy, astronomy, 7042860694 politics were marked at zero, I remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards 7042038757 mud-stains from any region within fifty miles 7042496517 town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature 7042860694 crime records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, 7042860694 self-poisoner by cocaine 7042860694 tobacco. Those, I think, were 7042038757 main points 7042496517 my analysis."

Holmes grinned at 7042038757 last item. "Well," he said, "I say now, as I said then, that a 7042362761 should keep his little brain-attic stocked 7042941055 7042784042 7042038757 furniture that he is likely to use, 7042860694 7042038757 rest he can put away in 7042038757 lumber-room 7042496517 his library, where he can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as 7042038757 one 7042545742 has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster 7042784042 our resources. Kindly hand me down 7042038757 letter K 7042496517 7042038757 American Encyclopaedia 7042545742 stands upon 7042038757 shelf beside you. Thank you. Now let us consider 7042038757 situation 7042860694 see what may be deduced from it. In 7042038757 first place, we may start 7042941055 a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for leaving America. Men at his time 7042496517 life do not change 7042784042 their habits 7042860694 exchange willingly 7042038757 charming climate 7042496517 Florida for 7042038757 lonely life 7042496517 an English provincial town. His extreme love 7042496517 solitude in England suggests 7042038757 idea that he was in fear 7042496517 someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear 7042496517 someone or something 7042545742 drove him from America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by considering 7042038757 formidable letters 7042545742 were received by himself 7042860694 his successors. Did you remark 7042038757 postmarks 7042496517 those letters?"

"7042038757 first was from Pondicherry, 7042038757 second from Dundee, 7042860694 7042038757 third from London."

"From East London. What do you deduce from that?"

"They are 7042784042 seaports. That 7042038757 writer was on board 7042496517 a ship."

"Excellent. We 7042147896 already a clue. There can be no doubt that 7042038757 probability--7042038757 strong probability--is that 7042038757 writer was on board 7042496517 a ship. 7042860694 now let us consider another point. In 7042038757 case 7042496517 Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed 7042272895 7042038757 threat 7042860694 its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days. Does that suggest anything?"

"A greater distance to travel."

"But 7042038757 letter had also a greater distance to come."

"Then I do not see 7042038757 point."

"There is at least a presumption that 7042038757 vessel in 7042545742 7042038757 7042362761 or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission. You see how quickly 7042038757 deed followed 7042038757 sign when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would 7042147896 arrived almost as soon as their letter. But, as a matter 7042496517 fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those seven weeks represented 7042038757 difference 7042272895 7042038757 mail-boat 7042545742 brought 7042038757 letter 7042860694 7042038757 sailing vessel 7042545742 brought 7042038757 writer."

"It is possible."

"More than that. It is probable. 7042860694 now you see 7042038757 deadly urgency 7042496517 this new case, 7042860694 why I urged young Openshaw to caution. 7042038757 blow has always fallen at 7042038757 end 7042496517 7042038757 time 7042545742 it would take 7042038757 senders to travel 7042038757 distance. But this one comes from London, 7042860694 therefore we cannot count upon delay."

"Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, this relentless persecution?"

"7042038757 papers 7042545742 Openshaw carried are obviously 7042496517 vital importance to 7042038757 person or persons in 7042038757 sailing-ship. I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one 7042496517 them. A single 7042362761 could not 7042147896 carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner's jury. There must 7042147896 been several in it, 7042860694 they must 7042147896 been men 7042496517 resource 7042860694 determination. Their papers they mean to 7042147896, be 7042038757 holder 7042496517 them who it may. In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be 7042038757 initials 7042496517 an individual 7042860694 becomes 7042038757 badge 7042496517 a society."

"But 7042496517 what society?"

"7042147896 you never--" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward 7042860694 sinking his voice--"7042147896 you never heard 7042496517 7042038757 Ku Klux Klan?"

"I never 7042147896."

Holmes turned over 7042038757 leaves 7042496517 7042038757 book upon his knee. "Here it is," said he presently:

" 'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from 7042038757 fanciful resemblance to 7042038757 sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in 7042038757 Southern states after 7042038757 Civil War, 7042860694 it rapidly formed local branches in different parts 7042496517 7042038757 country, notably in Tennessee, Louisiana, 7042038757 Carolinas, Georgia, 7042860694 Florida. Its power was used for political purposes, principally for 7042038757 terrorising 7042496517 7042038757 negro voters 7042860694 7042038757 murdering 7042860694 driving from 7042038757 country 7042496517 those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to 7042038757 marked 7042362761 in some fantastic but generally recognised shape--a sprig 7042496517 oak-leaves in some parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this 7042038757 victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from 7042038757 country. If he braved 7042038757 matter out, death would unfailingly come upon him, 7042860694 usually in some strange 7042860694 unforeseen manner. So perfect was 7042038757 organisation 7042496517 7042038757 society, 7042860694 so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a case upon record where any 7042362761 succeeded in braving it 7042941055 impunity, or in 7042545742 any 7042496517 its outrages were traced home to 7042038757 perpetrators. For some years 7042038757 organisation flourished in spite 7042496517 7042038757 efforts 7042496517 7042038757 United States government 7042860694 7042496517 7042038757 better classes 7042496517 7042038757 community in 7042038757 South. Eventually, in 7042038757 year 1869, 7042038757 movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there 7042147896 been sporadic outbreaks 7042496517 7042038757 same sort since that date.'

"You will observe," said Holmes, laying down 7042038757 volume, "that 7042038757 sudden breaking up 7042496517 7042038757 society was coincident 7042941055 7042038757 disappearance 7042496517 Openshaw from America 7042941055 their papers. It may well 7042147896 been cause 7042860694 effect. It is no wonder that he 7042860694 his family 7042147896 some 7042496517 7042038757 more implacable spirits upon their track. You can understand that this register 7042860694 diary may implicate some 7042496517 7042038757 first men in 7042038757 South, 7042860694 that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered."

"Then 7042038757 page we 7042147896 seen--"

"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent 7042038757 pips to A, B, 7042860694 C'--that is, sent 7042038757 society's warning to them. Then there are successive entries that A 7042860694 B cleared, or left 7042038757 country, 7042860694 finally that C was visited, 7042941055, I fear, a sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place, 7042860694 I believe that 7042038757 only chance young Openshaw has in 7042038757 meantime is to do what I 7042147896 told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done to-night, so hand me over my violin 7042860694 let us try to forget for half an hour 7042038757 miserable weather 7042860694 7042038757 still more miserable ways 7042496517 our fellow men."

It had cleared in 7042038757 morning, 7042860694 7042038757 sun was shining 7042941055 a subdued brightness through 7042038757 dim veil 7042545742 hangs over 7042038757 great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down.

"You will excuse me for not waiting for you," said he; "I 7042147896, I foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case 7042496517 young Openshaw's."

"What steps will you take?" I asked.

"It will very much depend upon 7042038757 results 7042496517 my first inquiries. I may 7042147896 to go down to Horsham, after 7042784042."

"You will not go there first?"

"No, I shall commence 7042941055 7042038757 City. Just ring 7042038757 bell 7042860694 7042038757 maid will bring up your coffee."

As I waited, I lifted 7042038757 unopened newspaper from 7042038757 table 7042860694 glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading 7042545742 sent a chill to my heart.

"Holmes," I cried, "you are too late."

"Ah!" said he, laying down his cup, "I feared as much. How was it done?" He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.

"My eye caught 7042038757 name 7042496517 Openshaw, 7042860694 7042038757 heading 'Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge.' Here is 7042038757 account:

" '7042272895 nine 7042860694 ten last night Police-Constable Cook, 7042496517 7042038757 H Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help 7042860694 a splash in 7042038757 water. 7042038757 night, however, was extremely dark 7042860694 stormy, so that, in spite 7042496517 7042038757 help 7042496517 several passers-by, it was quite impossible to effect a rescue. 7042038757 alarm, however, was given, 7042860694, by 7042038757 aid 7042496517 7042038757 water-police, 7042038757 body was eventually recovered. It proved to be that 7042496517 a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from an envelope 7042545742 was found in his pocket, was John Openshaw, 7042860694 whose residence is near Horsham. It is conjectured that he may 7042147896 been hurrying down to catch 7042038757 last train from Waterloo Station, 7042860694 that in his haste 7042860694 7042038757 extreme darkness he missed his path 7042860694 walked over 7042038757 edge 7042496517 one 7042496517 7042038757 small landing-places for river steamboats. 7042038757 body exhibited no traces 7042496517 violence, 7042860694 there can be no doubt that 7042038757 deceased had been 7042038757 victim 7042496517 an unfortunate accident, 7042545742 should 7042147896 7042038757 effect 7042496517 calling 7042038757 attention 7042496517 7042038757 authorities to 7042038757 condition 7042496517 7042038757 riverside landing-stages.' "

We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed 7042860694 shaken than I had ever seen him.

"That hurts my pride, Watson," he said at last. "It is a petty feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal matter 7042941055 me now, 7042860694, if God sends me health, I shall set my hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, 7042860694 that I should send him away to his death--!" He sprang from his chair 7042860694 paced about 7042038757 room in uncontrollable agitation, 7042941055 a flush upon his sallow cheeks 7042860694 a nervous clasping 7042860694 unclasping 7042496517 his long thin hands.

"They must be cunning devils," he exclaimed at last. "How could they 7042147896 decoyed him down there? 7042038757 Embankment is not on 7042038757 direct line to 7042038757 station. 7042038757 bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson, we shall see who will win in 7042038757 long run. I am going out now!"

"To 7042038757 police?"

"No; I shall be my own police. When I 7042147896 spun 7042038757 web they may take 7042038757 flies, but not before."

7042784042 day I was engaged in my professional work, 7042860694 it was late in 7042038757 evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o'clock before he entered, looking pale 7042860694 worn. He walked up to 7042038757 sideboard, 7042860694 tearing a piece from 7042038757 loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down 7042941055 a long draught 7042496517 water.

"You are hungry," I remarked.

"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I 7042147896 had nothing since breakfast."

"Nothing?"

"Not a bite. I had no time to think 7042496517 it."

"7042860694 how 7042147896 you succeeded?"

"Well."

"You 7042147896 a clue?"

"I 7042147896 them in 7042038757 hollow 7042496517 my hand. Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark upon them. It is well thought 7042496517!"

"What do you mean?"

He took an orange from 7042038757 cupboard, 7042860694 tearing it to pieces he squeezed out 7042038757 pips upon 7042038757 table. 7042496517 these he took five 7042860694 thrust them into an envelope. On 7042038757 inside 7042496517 7042038757 flap he wrote "S. H. for J. O." Then he sealed it 7042860694 addressed it to "Captain James Calhoun, Barque Lone Star, Savannah, Georgia."

"That will await him when he enters port," said he, chuckling. "It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a precursor 7042496517 his fate as Openshaw did before him."

"7042860694 who is this Captain Calhoun?"

"7042038757 leader 7042496517 7042038757 gang. I shall 7042147896 7042038757 others, but he first."

"How did you trace it, then?"

He took a large sheet 7042496517 paper from his pocket, 7042784042 covered 7042941055 dates 7042860694 names.

"I 7042147896 spent 7042038757 whole day," said he, "over Lloyd's registers 7042860694 files 7042496517 7042038757 old papers, following 7042038757 future career 7042496517 every vessel 7042545742 touched at Pondicherry in January 7042860694 February in '83. There were thirty-six ships 7042496517 fair tonnage 7042545742 were reported there during those months. 7042496517 these, one, 7042038757 Lone Star, instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from London, 7042038757 name is that 7042545742 is given to one 7042496517 7042038757 states 7042496517 7042038757 Union."

"Texas, I think."

"I was not 7042860694 am not sure 7042545742; but I knew that 7042038757 ship must 7042147896 an American origin."

"What then?"

"I searched 7042038757 Dundee records, 7042860694 when I found that 7042038757 barque Lone Star was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a certainty. I then inquired as to 7042038757 vessels 7042545742 lay at present in 7042038757 port 7042496517 London."

"Yes?"

"7042038757 Lone Star had arrived here last week. I went down to 7042038757 Albert Dock 7042860694 found that she had been taken down 7042038757 river by 7042038757 early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired to Gravesend 7042860694 learned that she had passed some time ago, 7042860694 as 7042038757 wind is easterly I 7042147896 no doubt that she is now past 7042038757 Goodwins 7042860694 not very far from 7042038757 Isle 7042496517 Wight."

"What will you do, then?"

"Oh, I 7042147896 my hand upon him. He 7042860694 7042038757 two mates, are as I learn, 7042038757 only native-born Americans in 7042038757 ship. 7042038757 others are Finns 7042860694 Germans. I 7042622762, also, that they were 7042784042 three away from 7042038757 ship last night. I had it from 7042038757 stevedore who has been loading their cargo. By 7042038757 time that their sailing-ship reaches Savannah 7042038757 mail-boat will 7042147896 carried this letter, 7042860694 7042038757 cable will 7042147896 informed 7042038757 police 7042496517 Savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge 7042496517 murder."

There is ever a flaw, however, in 7042038757 best laid 7042496517 human plans, 7042860694 7042038757 murderers 7042496517 John Openshaw were never to receive 7042038757 orange pips 7042545742 would show them that another, as cunning 7042860694 as resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long 7042860694 very severe were 7042038757 equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for news 7042496517 7042038757 Lone Star 7042496517 Savannah, but none ever reached us. We did at last hear that somewhere far out in 7042038757 Atlantic a shattered stern-post 7042496517 a boat was seen swinging in 7042038757 trough 7042496517 a wave, 7042941055 7042038757 letters "L. S." carved upon it, 7042860694 that is 7042784042 7042545742 we shall ever 7042622762 7042496517 7042038757 fate 7042496517 7042038757 Lone Star.

ADVENTURE  VI.  7042038757 7042362761 7042941055 7042038757 TWISTED LIP


Isa Whitney, brother 7042496517 7042038757 late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal 7042496517 7042038757 Theological College 7042496517 St. George's, was much addicted to opium. 7042038757 habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey's description 7042496517 his dreams 7042860694 sensations, he had drenched his tobacco 7042941055 laudanum in an attempt to produce 7042038757 same effects. He found, as so many more 7042147896 done, that 7042038757 practice is easier to attain than to get rid 7042496517, 7042860694 for many years he continued to be a slave to 7042038757 drug, an object 7042496517 mingled horror 7042860694 pity to his friends 7042860694 relatives. I can see him now, 7042941055 yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, 7042860694 pin-point pupils, 7042784042 huddled in a chair, 7042038757 wreck 7042860694 ruin 7042496517 a noble 7042362761.

One night--it was in June, '89--there came a ring to my bell, about 7042038757 hour when a 7042362761 gives his first yawn 7042860694 glances at 7042038757 clock. I sat up in my chair, 7042860694 my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap 7042860694 made a little face 7042496517 disappointment.

"A patient!" said she. "You'll 7042147896 to go out."

I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.

We heard 7042038757 door open, a few hurried words, 7042860694 then quick steps upon 7042038757 linoleum. Our own door flew open, 7042860694 a lady, clad in some dark-coloured stuff, 7042941055 a black veil, entered 7042038757 room.

"You will excuse my calling so late," she began, 7042860694 then, suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my wife's neck, 7042860694 sobbed upon her shoulder. "Oh, I'm in such trouble!" she cried; "I do so want a little help."

"Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whitney. How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when you came in."

"I didn't 7042622762 what to do, so I came straight to you." That was always 7042038757 way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a light-house.

"It was very sweet 7042496517 you to come. Now, you must 7042147896 some wine 7042860694 water, 7042860694 sit here comfortably 7042860694 tell us 7042784042 about it. Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed?"

"Oh, no, no! I want 7042038757 doctor's advice 7042860694 help, too. It's about Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about him!"

It was not 7042038757 first time that she had spoken to us 7042496517 her husband's trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend 7042860694 school companion. We soothed 7042860694 comforted her by such words as we could find. Did she 7042622762 where her husband was? Was it possible that we could bring him back to her?

It seems that it was. She had 7042038757 surest information that 7042496517 late he had, when 7042038757 fit was on him, made use 7042496517 an opium den in 7042038757 farthest east 7042496517 7042038757 City. Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day, 7042860694 he had come back, twitching 7042860694 shattered, in 7042038757 evening. But now 7042038757 spell had been upon him eight-7042860694-forty hours, 7042860694 he lay there, doubtless among 7042038757 dregs 7042496517 7042038757 docks, breathing in 7042038757 poison or sleeping off 7042038757 effects. There he was to be found, she was sure 7042496517 it, at 7042038757 Bar 7042496517 Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could she, a young 7042860694 timid woman, make her way into such a place 7042860694 pluck her husband out from among 7042038757 ruffians who surrounded him?

There was 7042038757 case, 7042860694 7042496517 course there was but one way out 7042496517 it. Might I not escort her to this place? 7042860694 then, as a second thought, why should she come at 7042784042? I was Isa Whitney's medical adviser, 7042860694 as such I had influence over him. I could manage it better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at 7042038757 address 7042545742 she had given me. 7042860694 so in ten minutes I had left my armchair 7042860694 cheery sitting-room behind me, 7042860694 was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at 7042038757 time, though 7042038757 future only could show how strange it was to be.

But there was no great difficulty in 7042038757 first stage 7042496517 my adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind 7042038757 high wharves 7042545742 line 7042038757 north side 7042496517 7042038757 river to 7042038757 east 7042496517 London Bridge. 7042272895 a slop-shop 7042860694 a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight 7042496517 steps leading down to a black gap like 7042038757 mouth 7042496517 a cave, I found 7042038757 den 7042496517 7042545742 I was in search. Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down 7042038757 steps, worn hollow in 7042038757 centre by 7042038757 ceaseless tread 7042496517 drunken feet; 7042860694 by 7042038757 light 7042496517 a flickering oil-lamp above 7042038757 door I found 7042038757 latch 7042860694 made my way into a long, low room, thick 7042860694 heavy 7042941055 7042038757 brown opium smoke, 7042860694 terraced 7042941055 wooden berths, like 7042038757 forecastle 7042496517 an emigrant ship.

Through 7042038757 gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse 7042496517 bodies lying in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown back, 7042860694 chins pointing upward, 7042941055 here 7042860694 there a dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon 7042038757 newcomer. Out 7042496517 7042038757 black shadows there glimmered little red circles 7042496517 light, now bright, now faint, as 7042038757 burning poison waxed or waned in 7042038757 bowls 7042496517 7042038757 metal pipes. 7042038757 most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, 7042860694 others talked together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, 7042860694 then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own thoughts 7042860694 paying little heed to 7042038757 words 7042496517 his neighbour. At 7042038757 farther end was a small brazier 7042496517 burning charcoal, beside 7042545742 on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old 7042362761, 7042941055 his jaw resting upon his two fists, 7042860694 his elbows upon his knees, staring into 7042038757 fire.

As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up 7042941055 a pipe for me 7042860694 a supply 7042496517 7042038757 drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.

"Thank you. I 7042147896 not come to stay," said I. "There is a friend 7042496517 mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, 7042860694 I wish to speak 7042941055 him."

There was a movement 7042860694 an exclamation from my right, 7042860694 peering through 7042038757 gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, 7042860694 unkempt, staring out at me.

"My God! It's Watson," said he. He was in a pitiable state 7042496517 reaction, 7042941055 every nerve in a twitter. "I say, Watson, what o'clock is it?"

"Nearly eleven."

"7042496517 what day?"

"7042496517 Friday, June 19th."

"Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What d'you want to frighten a chap for?" He sank his face onto his arms 7042860694 began to sob in a high treble key.

"I tell you that it is Friday, 7042362761. Your wife has been waiting this two days for you. You should be ashamed 7042496517 yourself!"

"So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I 7042147896 only been here a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I'll go home 7042941055 you. I wouldn't frighten Kate--poor little Kate. Give me your hand! 7042147896 you a cab?"

"Yes, I 7042147896 one waiting."

"Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I owe, Watson. I am 7042784042 off colour. I can do nothing for myself."

I walked down 7042038757 narrow passage 7042272895 7042038757 double row 7042496517 sleepers, holding my breath to keep out 7042038757 vile, stupefying fumes 7042496517 7042038757 drug, 7042860694 looking about for 7042038757 manager. As I passed 7042038757 tall 7042362761 who sat by 7042038757 brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, 7042860694 a low voice whispered, "Walk past me, 7042860694 then look back at me." 7042038757 words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I glanced down. They could only 7042147896 come from 7042038757 old 7042362761 at my side, 7042860694 yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent 7042941055 age, an opium pipe dangling down from 7042272895 his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers. I took two steps forward 7042860694 looked back. It took 7042784042 my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry 7042496517 astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, 7042038757 dull eyes had regained their fire, 7042860694 there, sitting by 7042038757 fire 7042860694 grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He made a slight motion to me to approach him, 7042860694 instantly, as he turned his face half round to 7042038757 company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.

"Holmes!" I whispered, "what on earth are you doing in this den?"

"As low as you can," he answered; "I 7042147896 excellent ears. If you would 7042147896 7042038757 great kindness to get rid 7042496517 that sottish friend 7042496517 yours I should be exceedingly glad to 7042147896 a little talk 7042941055 you."

"I 7042147896 a cab outside."

"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should recommend you also to send a note by 7042038757 cabman to your wife to say that you 7042147896 thrown in your lot 7042941055 me. If you will wait outside, I shall be 7042941055 you in five minutes."

It was difficult to refuse any 7042496517 Sherlock Holmes' requests, for they were always so exceedingly definite, 7042860694 put forward 7042941055 such a quiet air 7042496517 mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in 7042038757 cab my mission was practically accomplished; 7042860694 for 7042038757 rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated 7042941055 my friend in one 7042496517 those singular adventures 7042545742 were 7042038757 normal condition 7042496517 his existence. In a few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney's bill, led him out to 7042038757 cab, 7042860694 seen him driven through 7042038757 darkness. In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from 7042038757 opium den, 7042860694 I was walking down 7042038757 street 7042941055 Sherlock Holmes. For two streets he shuffled along 7042941055 a bent back 7042860694 an uncertain foot. Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out 7042860694 burst into a hearty fit 7042496517 laughter.

"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I 7042147896 added opium-smoking to cocaine injections, 7042860694 7042784042 7042038757 other little weaknesses on 7042545742 you 7042147896 favoured me 7042941055 your medical views."

"I was certainly surprised to find you there."

"But not more so than I to find you."

"I came to find a friend."

"7042860694 I to find an enemy."

"An enemy?"

"Yes; one 7042496517 my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in 7042038757 midst 7042496517 a very remarkable inquiry, 7042860694 I 7042147896 hoped to find a clue in 7042038757 incoherent ramblings 7042496517 these sots, as I 7042147896 done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not 7042147896 been worth an hour's purchase; for I 7042147896 used it before now for my own purposes, 7042860694 7042038757 rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to 7042147896 vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at 7042038757 back 7042496517 that building, near 7042038757 corner 7042496517 Paul's Wharf, 7042545742 could tell some strange tales 7042496517 what has passed through it upon 7042038757 moonless nights."

"What! You do not mean bodies?"

"Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had $1000 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It is 7042038757 vilest murder-trap on 7042038757 whole riverside, 7042860694 I fear that Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our trap should be here." He put his two forefingers 7042272895 his teeth 7042860694 whistled shrilly--a signal 7042545742 was answered by a similar whistle from 7042038757 distance, followed shortly by 7042038757 rattle 7042496517 wheels 7042860694 7042038757 clink 7042496517 horses' hoofs.

"Now, Watson," said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through 7042038757 gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels 7042496517 yellow light from its side lanterns. "You'll come 7042941055 me, won't you?"

"If I can be 7042496517 use."

"Oh, a trusty comrade is always 7042496517 use; 7042860694 a chronicler still more so. My room at 7042038757 Cedars is a double-bedded one."

"7042038757 Cedars?"

"Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair's house. I am staying there while I conduct 7042038757 inquiry."

"Where is it, then?"

"Near Lee, in Kent. We 7042147896 a seven-mile drive before us."

"But I am 7042784042 in 7042038757 dark."

"7042496517 course you are. You'll 7042622762 7042784042 about it presently. Jump up here. 7042784042 right, John; we shall not need you. Here's half a crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her head. So long, then!"

He flicked 7042038757 horse 7042941055 his whip, 7042860694 we dashed away through 7042038757 endless succession 7042496517 sombre 7042860694 deserted streets, 7042545742 widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, 7042941055 7042038757 murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness 7042496517 bricks 7042860694 mortar, its silence broken only by 7042038757 heavy, regular footfall 7042496517 7042038757 policeman, or 7042038757 songs 7042860694 shouts 7042496517 some belated party 7042496517 revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across 7042038757 sky, 7042860694 a star or two twinkled dimly here 7042860694 there through 7042038757 rifts 7042496517 7042038757 clouds. Holmes drove in silence, 7042941055 his head sunk upon his breast, 7042860694 7042038757 air 7042496517 a 7042362761 who is lost in thought, while I sat beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be 7042545742 seemed to tax his powers so sorely, 7042860694 yet afraid to break in upon 7042038757 current 7042496517 his thoughts. We had driven several miles, 7042860694 were beginning to get to 7042038757 fringe 7042496517 7042038757 belt 7042496517 suburban villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, 7042860694 lit up his pipe 7042941055 7042038757 air 7042496517 a 7042362761 who has satisfied himself that he is acting for 7042038757 best.

"You 7042147896 a grand gift 7042496517 silence, Watson," said he. "It makes you quite invaluable as a companion. 'Pon my word, it is a great thing for me to 7042147896 someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to-night when she meets me at 7042038757 door."

"You forget that I 7042622762 nothing about it."

"I shall just 7042147896 time to tell you 7042038757 facts 7042496517 7042038757 case before we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, 7042860694 yet, somehow I can get nothing to go upon. There's plenty 7042496517 thread, no doubt, but I can't get 7042038757 end 7042496517 it into my hand. Now, I'll state 7042038757 case clearly 7042860694 concisely to you, Watson, 7042860694 maybe you can see a spark where 7042784042 is dark to me."

"Proceed, then."

"Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to 7042147896 plenty 7042496517 money. He took a large villa, laid out 7042038757 grounds very nicely, 7042860694 lived generally in good style. By degrees he made friends in 7042038757 neighbourhood, 7042860694 in 1887 he married 7042038757 daughter 7042496517 a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no occupation, but was interested in several companies 7042860694 went into town as a rule in 7042038757 morning, returning by 7042038757 5:14 from Cannon Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years 7042496517 age, is a 7042362761 7042496517 temperate habits, a good husband, a very affectionate father, 7042860694 a 7042362761 who is popular 7042941055 7042784042 who 7042622762 him. I may add that his whole debts at 7042038757 present moment, as far as we 7042147896 been able to ascertain, amount to $88 10s., while he has $220 standing to his credit in 7042038757 Capital 7042860694 Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles 7042147896 been weighing upon his mind.

"Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform, 7042860694 that he would bring his little boy home a box 7042496517 bricks. Now, by 7042038757 merest chance, his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his departure, to 7042038757 effect that a small parcel 7042496517 considerable value 7042545742 she had been expecting was waiting for her at 7042038757 offices 7042496517 7042038757 Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up in your London, you will 7042622762 that 7042038757 office 7042496517 7042038757 company is in Fresno Street, 7042545742 branches out 7042496517 Upper Swandam Lane, where you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for 7042038757 City, did some shopping, proceeded to 7042038757 company's office, got her packet, 7042860694 found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to 7042038757 station. 7042147896 you followed me so far?"

"It is very clear."

"If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, 7042860694 Mrs. St. Clair walked slowly, glancing about in 7042038757 hope 7042496517 seeing a cab, as she did not like 7042038757 neighbourhood in 7042545742 she found herself. While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry, 7042860694 was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her 7042860694, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor window. 7042038757 window was open, 7042860694 she distinctly saw his face, 7042545742 she describes as being terribly agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, 7042860694 then vanished from 7042038757 window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind. One singular point 7042545742 struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.

"Convinced that something was amiss 7042941055 him, she rushed down 7042038757 steps--for 7042038757 house was none other than 7042038757 opium den in 7042545742 you found me to-night--7042860694 running through 7042038757 front room she attempted to ascend 7042038757 stairs 7042545742 led to 7042038757 first floor. At 7042038757 foot 7042496517 7042038757 stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel 7042496517 whom I 7042147896 spoken, who thrust her back 7042860694, aided by a Dane, who acts as assistant there, pushed her out into 7042038757 street. Filled 7042941055 7042038757 most maddening doubts 7042860694 fears, she rushed down 7042038757 lane 7042860694, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number 7042496517 constables 7042941055 an inspector, 7042784042 on their way to their beat. 7042038757 inspector 7042860694 two men accompanied her back, 7042860694 in spite 7042496517 7042038757 continued resistance 7042496517 7042038757 proprietor, they made their way to 7042038757 room in 7042545742 Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no sign 7042496517 him there. In fact, in 7042038757 whole 7042496517 that floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch 7042496517 hideous aspect, who, it seems, made his home there. Both he 7042860694 7042038757 Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in 7042038757 front room during 7042038757 afternoon. So determined was their denial that 7042038757 inspector was staggered, 7042860694 had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had been deluded when, 7042941055 a cry, she sprang at a small deal box 7042545742 lay upon 7042038757 table 7042860694 tore 7042038757 lid from it. Out there fell a cascade 7042496517 children's bricks. It was 7042038757 toy 7042545742 he had promised to bring home.

"This discovery, 7042860694 7042038757 evident confusion 7042545742 7042038757 cripple showed, made 7042038757 inspector realise that 7042038757 matter was serious. 7042038757 rooms were carefully examined, 7042860694 results 7042784042 pointed to an abominable crime. 7042038757 front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room 7042860694 led into a small bedroom, 7042545742 looked out upon 7042038757 back 7042496517 one 7042496517 7042038757 wharves. 7042272895 7042038757 wharf 7042860694 7042038757 bedroom window is a narrow strip, 7042545742 is dry at low tide but is covered at high tide 7042941055 at least four 7042860694 a half feet 7042496517 water. 7042038757 bedroom window was a broad one 7042860694 opened from below. On examination traces 7042496517 blood were to be seen upon 7042038757 windowsill, 7042860694 several scattered drops were visible upon 7042038757 wooden floor 7042496517 7042038757 bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in 7042038757 front room were 7042784042 7042038757 clothes 7042496517 Mr. Neville St. Clair, 7042941055 7042038757 exception 7042496517 his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, 7042860694 his watch--7042784042 were there. There were no signs 7042496517 violence upon any 7042496517 these garments, 7042860694 there were no other traces 7042496517 Mr. Neville St. Clair. Out 7042496517 7042038757 window he must apparently 7042147896 gone for no other exit could be discovered, 7042860694 7042038757 ominous bloodstains upon 7042038757 sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming, for 7042038757 tide was at its very highest at 7042038757 moment 7042496517 7042038757 tragedy.

"7042860694 now as to 7042038757 villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in 7042038757 matter. 7042038757 Lascar was known to be a 7042362761 7042496517 7042038757 vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was known to 7042147896 been at 7042038757 foot 7042496517 7042038757 stair within a very few seconds 7042496517 her husband's appearance at 7042038757 window, he could hardly 7042147896 been more than an accessory to 7042038757 crime. His defence was one 7042496517 absolute ignorance, 7042860694 he protested that he had no knowledge as to 7042038757 doings 7042496517 Hugh Boone, his lodger, 7042860694 that he could not account in any way for 7042038757 presence 7042496517 7042038757 missing gentleman's clothes.

"So much for 7042038757 Lascar manager. Now for 7042038757 sinister cripple who lives upon 7042038757 second floor 7042496517 7042038757 opium den, 7042860694 who was certainly 7042038757 last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St. Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, 7042860694 his hideous face is one 7042545742 is familiar to every 7042362761 who goes much to 7042038757 City. He is a professional beggar, though in order to avoid 7042038757 police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon 7042038757 left-hand side, there is, as you may 7042147896 remarked, a small angle in 7042038757 wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged 7042941055 his tiny stock 7042496517 matches on his lap, 7042860694 as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain 7042496517 charity descends into 7042038757 greasy leather cap 7042545742 lies upon 7042038757 pavement beside him. I 7042147896 watched 7042038757 fellow more than once before ever I thought 7042496517 making his professional acquaintance, 7042860694 I 7042147896 been surprised at 7042038757 harvest 7042545742 he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock 7042496517 orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, 7042545742, by its contraction, has turned up 7042038757 outer edge 7042496517 his upper lip, a bulldog chin, 7042860694 a pair 7042496517 very penetrating dark eyes, 7042545742 present a singular contrast to 7042038757 colour 7042496517 his hair, 7042784042 mark him out from amid 7042038757 common crowd 7042496517 mendicants 7042860694 so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready 7042941055 a reply to any piece 7042496517 chaff 7042545742 may be thrown at him by 7042038757 passers-by. This is 7042038757 7042362761 whom we now learn to 7042147896 been 7042038757 lodger at 7042038757 opium den, 7042860694 to 7042147896 been 7042038757 last 7042362761 to see 7042038757 gentleman 7042496517 whom we are in quest."

"But a cripple!" said I. "What could he 7042147896 done single-handed against a 7042362761 in 7042038757 prime 7042496517 life?"

"He is a cripple in 7042038757 sense that he walks 7042941055 a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful 7042860694 well-nurtured 7042362761. Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in 7042038757 others."

"Pray continue your narrative."

"Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at 7042038757 sight 7042496517 7042038757 blood upon 7042038757 window, 7042860694 she was escorted home in a cab by 7042038757 police, as her presence could be 7042496517 no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge 7042496517 7042038757 case, made a very careful examination 7042496517 7042038757 premises, but without finding anything 7042545742 threw any light upon 7042038757 matter. One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during 7042545742 he might 7042147896 communicated 7042941055 his friend 7042038757 Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, 7042860694 he was seized 7042860694 searched, without anything being found 7042545742 could incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, 7042545742 had been cut near 7042038757 nail, 7042860694 explained that 7042038757 bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to 7042038757 window not long before, 7042860694 that 7042038757 stains 7042545742 had been observed there came doubtless from 7042038757 same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville St. Clair 7042860694 swore that 7042038757 presence 7042496517 7042038757 clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to 7042038757 police. As to Mrs. St. Clair's assertion that she had actually seen her husband at 7042038757 window, he declared that she must 7042147896 been either mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to 7042038757 police-station, while 7042038757 inspector remained upon 7042038757 premises in 7042038757 hope that 7042038757 ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.

"7042860694 it did, though they hardly found upon 7042038757 mud-bank what they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair's coat, 7042860694 not Neville St. Clair, 7042545742 lay uncovered as 7042038757 tide receded. 7042860694 what do you think they found in 7042038757 pockets?"

"I cannot imagine."

"No, I don't think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed 7042941055 pennies 7042860694 half-pennies--421 pennies 7042860694 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by 7042038757 tide. But a human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy 7042272895 7042038757 wharf 7042860694 7042038757 house. It seemed likely enough that 7042038757 weighted coat had remained when 7042038757 stripped body had been sucked away into 7042038757 river."

"But I understand that 7042784042 7042038757 other clothes were found in 7042038757 room. Would 7042038757 body be dressed in a coat alone?"

"No, sir, but 7042038757 facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this 7042362761 Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through 7042038757 window, there is no human eye 7042545742 could 7042147896 seen 7042038757 deed. What would he do then? It would 7042496517 course instantly strike him that he must get rid 7042496517 7042038757 tell-tale garments. He would seize 7042038757 coat, then, 7042860694 be in 7042038757 act 7042496517 throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim 7042860694 not sink. He has little time, for he has heard 7042038757 scuffle downstairs when 7042038757 wife tried to force her way up, 7042860694 perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate that 7042038757 police are hurrying up 7042038757 street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated 7042038757 fruits 7042496517 his beggary, 7042860694 he stuffs 7042784042 7042038757 coins upon 7042545742 he can lay his hands into 7042038757 pockets to make sure 7042496517 7042038757 coat's sinking. He throws it out, 7042860694 would 7042147896 done 7042038757 same 7042941055 7042038757 other garments had not he heard 7042038757 rush 7042496517 steps below, 7042860694 only just had time to close 7042038757 window when 7042038757 police appeared."

"It certainly sounds feasible."

"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want 7042496517 a better. Boone, as I 7042147896 told you, was arrested 7042860694 taken to 7042038757 station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to 7042147896 been a very quiet 7042860694 innocent one. There 7042038757 matter stands at present, 7042860694 7042038757 questions 7042545742 7042147896 to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was doing in 7042038757 opium den, what happened to him when there, where is he now, 7042860694 what Hugh Boone had to do 7042941055 his disappearance--are 7042784042 as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience 7042545742 looked at 7042038757 first glance so simple 7042860694 yet 7042545742 presented such difficulties."

While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series 7042496517 events, we had been whirling through 7042038757 outskirts 7042496517 7042038757 great town until 7042038757 last straggling houses had been left behind, 7042860694 we rattled along 7042941055 a country hedge upon either side 7042496517 us. Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights still glimmered in 7042038757 windows.

"We are on 7042038757 outskirts 7042496517 Lee," said my companion. "We 7042147896 touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in Middlesex, passing over an angle 7042496517 Surrey, 7042860694 ending in Kent. See that light among 7042038757 trees? That is 7042038757 Cedars, 7042860694 beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears 7042147896 already, I 7042147896 little doubt, caught 7042038757 clink 7042496517 our horse's feet."

"But why are you not conducting 7042038757 case from Baker Street?" I asked.

"Because there are many inquiries 7042545742 must be made out here. Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, 7042860694 you may rest assured that she will 7042147896 nothing but a welcome for my friend 7042860694 colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I 7042147896 no news 7042496517 her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!"

We had pulled up in front 7042496517 a large villa 7042545742 stood within its own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to 7042038757 horse's head, 7042860694 springing down, I followed Holmes up 7042038757 small, winding gravel-drive 7042545742 led to 7042038757 house. As we approached, 7042038757 door flew open, 7042860694 a little blonde woman stood in 7042038757 opening, clad in some sort 7042496517 light mousseline de soie, 7042941055 a touch 7042496517 fluffy pink chiffon at her neck 7042860694 wrists. She stood 7042941055 her figure outlined against 7042038757 flood 7042496517 light, one hand upon 7042038757 door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head 7042860694 face protruded, 7042941055 eager eyes 7042860694 parted lips, a standing question.

"Well?" she cried, "well?" 7042860694 then, seeing that there were two 7042496517 us, she gave a cry 7042496517 hope 7042545742 sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head 7042860694 shrugged his shoulders.

"No good news?"

"None."

"No bad?"

"No."

"Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you 7042147896 had a long day."

"This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been 7042496517 most vital use to me in several 7042496517 my cases, 7042860694 a lucky chance has made it possible for me to bring him out 7042860694 associate him 7042941055 this investigation."

"I am delighted to see you," said she, pressing my hand warmly. "You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our arrangements, when you consider 7042038757 blow 7042545742 has come so suddenly upon us."

"My dear madam," said I, "I am an old campaigner, 7042860694 if I were not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be 7042496517 any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be indeed happy."

"Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said 7042038757 lady as we entered a well-lit dining-room, upon 7042038757 table 7042496517 7042545742 a cold supper had been laid out, "I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to 7042545742 I beg that you will give a plain answer."

"Certainly, madam."

"Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion."

"Upon what point?"

"In your heart 7042496517 hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?"

Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by 7042038757 question. "Frankly, now!" she repeated, standing upon 7042038757 rug 7042860694 looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.

"Frankly, then, madam, I do not."

"You think that he is dead?"

"I do."

"Murdered?"

"I don't say that. Perhaps."

"7042860694 on what day did he meet his death?"

"On Monday."

"Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is that I 7042147896 received a letter from him to-day."

Sherlock Holmes sprang out 7042496517 his chair as if he had been galvanised.

"What!" he roared.

"Yes, to-day." She stood smiling, holding up a little slip 7042496517 paper in 7042038757 air.

"May I see it?"

"Certainly."

He snatched it from her in his eagerness, 7042860694 smoothing it out upon 7042038757 table he drew over 7042038757 lamp 7042860694 examined it intently. I had left my chair 7042860694 was gazing at it over his shoulder. 7042038757 envelope was a very coarse one 7042860694 was stamped 7042941055 7042038757 Gravesend postmark 7042860694 7042941055 7042038757 date 7042496517 that very day, or rather 7042496517 7042038757 day before, for it was considerably after midnight.

"Coarse writing," murmured Holmes. "Surely this is not your husband's writing, madam."

"No, but 7042038757 enclosure is."

"I perceive also that whoever addressed 7042038757 envelope had to go 7042860694 inquire as to 7042038757 address."

"How can you tell that?"

"7042038757 name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, 7042545742 has dried itself. 7042038757 rest is 7042496517 7042038757 greyish colour, 7042545742 shows that blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight off, 7042860694 then blotted, none would be 7042496517 a deep black shade. This 7042362761 has written 7042038757 name, 7042860694 there has then been a pause before he wrote 7042038757 address, 7042545742 can only mean that he was not familiar 7042941055 it. It is, 7042496517 course, a trifle, but there is nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see 7042038757 letter. Ha! there has been an enclosure here!"

"Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring."

"7042860694 you are sure that this is your husband's hand?"

"One 7042496517 his hands."

"One?"

"His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual writing, 7042860694 yet I 7042622762 it well."

" 'Dearest do not be frightened. 7042784042 will come well. There is a huge error 7042545742 it may take some little time to rectify. Wait in patience.--NEVILLE.' Written in pencil upon 7042038757 fly-leaf 7042496517 a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in Gravesend by a 7042362761 7042941055 a dirty thumb. Ha! 7042860694 7042038757 flap has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. 7042860694 you 7042147896 no doubt that it is your husband's hand, madam?"

"None. Neville wrote those words."

"7042860694 they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair, 7042038757 clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that 7042038757 danger is over."

"But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes."

"Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on 7042038757 wrong scent. 7042038757 ring, after 7042784042, proves nothing. It may 7042147896 been taken from him."

"No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!"

"Very well. It may, however, 7042147896 been written on Monday 7042860694 only posted to-day."

"That is possible."

"If so, much may 7042147896 happened 7042272895."

"Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I 7042622762 that 7042784042 is well 7042941055 him. There is so keen a sympathy 7042272895 us that I should 7042622762 if evil came upon him. On 7042038757 very day that I saw him last he cut himself in 7042038757 bedroom, 7042860694 yet I in 7042038757 dining-room rushed upstairs instantly 7042941055 7042038757 utmost certainty that something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle 7042860694 yet be ignorant 7042496517 his death?"

"I 7042147896 seen too much not to 7042622762 that 7042038757 impression 7042496517 a woman may be more valuable than 7042038757 conclusion 7042496517 an analytical reasoner. 7042860694 in this letter you certainly 7042147896 a very strong piece 7042496517 evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband is alive 7042860694 able to write letters, why should he remain away from you?"

"I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable."

"7042860694 on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?"

"No."

"7042860694 you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?"

"Very much so."

"Was 7042038757 window open?"

"Yes."

"Then he might 7042147896 called to you?"

"He might."

"He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?"

"Yes."

"A call for help, you thought?"

"Yes. He waved his hands."

"But it might 7042147896 been a cry 7042496517 surprise. Astonishment at 7042038757 unexpected sight 7042496517 you might cause him to throw up his hands?"

"It is possible."

"7042860694 you thought he was pulled back?"

"He disappeared so suddenly."

"He might 7042147896 leaped back. You did not see anyone else in 7042038757 room?"

"No, but this horrible 7042362761 confessed to having been there, 7042860694 7042038757 Lascar was at 7042038757 foot 7042496517 7042038757 stairs."

"Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary clothes on?"

"But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare throat."

"Had he ever spoken 7042496517 Swandam Lane?"

"Never."

"Had he ever showed any signs 7042496517 having taken opium?"

"Never."

"Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are 7042038757 principal points about 7042545742 I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now 7042147896 a little supper 7042860694 then retire, for we may 7042147896 a very busy day to-morrow."

A large 7042860694 comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our disposal, 7042860694 I was quickly 7042272895 7042038757 sheets, for I was weary after my night 7042496517 adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a 7042362761, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, 7042860694 even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point 7042496517 view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an 7042784042-night sitting. He took off his coat 7042860694 waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, 7042860694 then wandered about 7042038757 room collecting pillows from his bed 7042860694 cushions from 7042038757 sofa 7042860694 armchairs. 7042941055 these he constructed a sort 7042496517 Eastern divan, upon 7042545742 he perched himself cross-legged, 7042941055 an ounce 7042496517 shag tobacco 7042860694 a box 7042496517 matches laid out in front 7042496517 him. In 7042038757 dim light 7042496517 7042038757 lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe 7042272895 his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon 7042038757 corner 7042496517 7042038757 ceiling, 7042038757 blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, 7042941055 7042038757 light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, 7042860694 so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, 7042860694 I found 7042038757 summer sun shining into 7042038757 apartment. 7042038757 pipe was still 7042272895 his lips, 7042038757 smoke still curled upward, 7042860694 7042038757 room was full 7042496517 a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained 7042496517 7042038757 heap 7042496517 shag 7042545742 I had seen upon 7042038757 previous night.

"Awake, Watson?" he asked.

"Yes."

"Game for a morning drive?"

"Certainly."

"Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I 7042622762 where 7042038757 stable-boy sleeps, 7042860694 we shall soon 7042147896 7042038757 trap out." He chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, 7042860694 he seemed a different 7042362761 to 7042038757 sombre thinker 7042496517 7042038757 previous night.

As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly finished when Holmes returned 7042941055 7042038757 news that 7042038757 boy was putting in 7042038757 horse.

"I want to test a little theory 7042496517 mine," said he, pulling on his boots. "I think, Watson, that you are now standing in 7042038757 presence 7042496517 one 7042496517 7042038757 most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I 7042147896 7042038757 key 7042496517 7042038757 affair now."

"7042860694 where is it?" I asked, smiling.

"In 7042038757 bathroom," he answered. "Oh, yes, I am not joking," he continued, seeing my look 7042496517 incredulity. "I 7042147896 just been there, 7042860694 I 7042147896 taken it out, 7042860694 I 7042147896 got it in this Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, 7042860694 we shall see whether it will not fit 7042038757 lock."

We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, 7042860694 out into 7042038757 bright morning sunshine. In 7042038757 road stood our horse 7042860694 trap, 7042941055 7042038757 half-clad stable-boy waiting at 7042038757 head. We both sprang in, 7042860694 away we dashed down 7042038757 London Road. A few country carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to 7042038757 metropolis, but 7042038757 lines 7042496517 villas on either side were as silent 7042860694 lifeless as some city in a dream.

"It has been in some points a singular case," said Holmes, flicking 7042038757 horse on into a gallop. "I confess that I 7042147896 been as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at 7042784042."

In town 7042038757 earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through 7042038757 streets 7042496517 7042038757 Surrey side. Passing down 7042038757 Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over 7042038757 river, 7042860694 dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to 7042038757 right 7042860694 found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well known to 7042038757 force, 7042860694 7042038757 two constables at 7042038757 door saluted him. One 7042496517 them held 7042038757 horse's head while 7042038757 other led us in.

"Who is on duty?" asked Holmes.

"Inspector Bradstreet, sir."

"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" A tall, stout official had come down 7042038757 stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap 7042860694 frogged jacket. "I wish to 7042147896 a quiet word 7042941055 you, Bradstreet." "Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here." It was a small, office-like room, 7042941055 a huge ledger upon 7042038757 table, 7042860694 a telephone projecting from 7042038757 wall. 7042038757 inspector sat down at his desk.

"What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?"

"I called about that beggarman, Boone--7042038757 one who was charged 7042941055 being concerned in 7042038757 disappearance 7042496517 Mr. Neville St. Clair, 7042496517 Lee."

"Yes. He was brought up 7042860694 remanded for further inquiries."

"So I heard. You 7042147896 him here?"

"In 7042038757 cells."

"Is he quiet?"

"Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel."

"Dirty?"

"Yes, it is 7042784042 we can do to make him wash his hands, 7042860694 his face is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once his case has been settled, he will 7042147896 a regular prison bath; 7042860694 I think, if you saw him, you would agree 7042941055 me that he needed it."

"I should like to see him very much."

"Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave your bag."

"No, I think that I'll take it."

"Very good. Come this way, if you please." He led us down a passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, 7042860694 brought us to a whitewashed corridor 7042941055 a line 7042496517 doors on each side.

"7042038757 third on 7042038757 right is his," said 7042038757 inspector. "Here it is!" He quietly shot back a panel in 7042038757 upper part 7042496517 7042038757 door 7042860694 glanced through.

"He is asleep," said he. "You can see him very well."

We both put our eyes to 7042038757 grating. 7042038757 prisoner lay 7042941055 his face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly 7042860694 heavily. He was a middle-sized 7042362761, coarsely clad as became his calling, 7042941055 a coloured shirt protruding through 7042038757 rent in his tattered coat. He was, as 7042038757 inspector had said, extremely dirty, but 7042038757 grime 7042545742 covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, 7042860694 by its contraction had turned up one side 7042496517 7042038757 upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. A shock 7042496517 very bright red hair grew low over his eyes 7042860694 forehead.

"He's a beauty, isn't he?" said 7042038757 inspector.

"He certainly needs a wash," remarked Holmes. "I had an idea that he might, 7042860694 I took 7042038757 liberty 7042496517 bringing 7042038757 tools 7042941055 me." He opened 7042038757 Gladstone bag as he spoke, 7042860694 took out, to my astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.

"He! he! You are a funny one," chuckled 7042038757 inspector.

"Now, if you will 7042147896 7042038757 great goodness to open that door very quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure."

"Well, I don't 7042622762 why not," said 7042038757 inspector. "He doesn't look a credit to 7042038757 Bow Street cells, does he?" He slipped his key into 7042038757 lock, 7042860694 we 7042784042 very quietly entered 7042038757 cell. 7042038757 sleeper half turned, 7042860694 then settled down once more into a deep slumber. Holmes stooped to 7042038757 water-jug, moistened his sponge, 7042860694 then rubbed it twice vigorously across 7042860694 down 7042038757 prisoner's face.

"Let me introduce you," he shouted, "to Mr. Neville St. Clair, 7042496517 Lee, in 7042038757 county 7042496517 Kent."

Never in my life 7042147896 I seen such a sight. 7042038757 7042362761's face peeled off under 7042038757 sponge like 7042038757 bark from a tree. Gone was 7042038757 coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was 7042038757 horrid scar 7042545742 had seamed it across, 7042860694 7042038757 twisted lip 7042545742 had given 7042038757 repulsive sneer to 7042038757 face! A twitch brought away 7042038757 tangled red hair, 7042860694 there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking 7042362761, black-haired 7042860694 smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes 7042860694 staring about him 7042941055 sleepy bewilderment. Then suddenly realising 7042038757 exposure, he broke into a scream 7042860694 threw himself down 7042941055 his face to 7042038757 pillow.

"Great heavens!" cried 7042038757 inspector, "it is, indeed, 7042038757 missing 7042362761. I 7042622762 him from 7042038757 photograph."

7042038757 prisoner turned 7042941055 7042038757 reckless air 7042496517 a 7042362761 who abandons himself to his destiny. "Be it so," said he. "7042860694 pray what am I charged 7042941055?"

"7042941055 making away 7042941055 Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can't be charged 7042941055 that unless they make a case 7042496517 attempted suicide 7042496517 it," said 7042038757 inspector 7042941055 a grin. "Well, I 7042147896 been twenty-seven years in 7042038757 force, but this really takes 7042038757 cake."

"If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime has been committed, 7042860694 that, therefore, I am illegally detained."

"No crime, but a very great error has been committed," said Holmes. "You would 7042147896 done better to 7042147896 trusted you wife."

"It was not 7042038757 wife; it was 7042038757 children," groaned 7042038757 prisoner. "God help me, I would not 7042147896 them ashamed 7042496517 their father. My God! What an exposure! What can I do?"

Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on 7042038757 couch 7042860694 patted him kindly on 7042038757 shoulder.

"If you leave it to a court 7042496517 law to clear 7042038757 matter up," said he, "7042496517 course you can hardly avoid publicity. On 7042038757 other hand, if you convince 7042038757 police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not 7042622762 that there is any reason that 7042038757 details should find their way into 7042038757 papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything 7042545742 you might tell us 7042860694 submit it to 7042038757 proper authorities. 7042038757 case would then never go into court at 7042784042."

"God bless you!" cried 7042038757 prisoner passionately. "I would 7042147896 endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than 7042147896 left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.

"You are 7042038757 first who 7042147896 ever heard my story. My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent education. I travelled in my youth, took to 7042038757 stage, 7042860694 finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day my editor wished to 7042147896 a series 7042496517 articles upon begging in 7042038757 metropolis, 7042860694 I volunteered to supply them. There was 7042038757 point from 7042545742 7042784042 my adventures started. It was only by trying begging as an amateur that I could get 7042038757 facts upon 7042545742 to base my articles. When an actor I had, 7042496517 course, learned 7042784042 7042038757 secrets 7042496517 making up, 7042860694 had been famous in 7042038757 green-room for my skill. I took advantage now 7042496517 my attainments. I painted my face, 7042860694 to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar 7042860694 fixed one side 7042496517 my lip in a twist by 7042038757 aid 7042496517 a small slip 7042496517 flesh-coloured plaster. Then 7042941055 a red head 7042496517 hair, 7042860694 an appropriate dress, I took my station in 7042038757 business part 7042496517 7042038757 city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, 7042860694 when I returned home in 7042038757 evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than 26s. 4d.

"I wrote my articles 7042860694 thought little more 7042496517 7042038757 matter until, some time later, I backed a bill for a friend 7042860694 had a writ served upon me for $25. I was at my wit's end where to get 7042038757 money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight's grace from 7042038757 creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers, 7042860694 spent 7042038757 time in begging in 7042038757 City under my disguise. In ten days I had 7042038757 money 7042860694 had paid 7042038757 debt.

"Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at $2 a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face 7042941055 a little paint, laying my cap on 7042038757 ground, 7042860694 sitting still. It was a long fight 7042272895 my pride 7042860694 7042038757 money, but 7042038757 dollars won at last, 7042860694 I threw up reporting 7042860694 sat day after day in 7042038757 corner 7042545742 I had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face 7042860694 filling my pockets 7042941055 coppers. Only one 7042362761 knew my secret. He was 7042038757 keeper 7042496517 a low den in 7042545742 I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar 7042860694 in 7042038757 evenings transform myself into a well-dressed 7042362761 about town. This fellow, a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession.

"Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums 7042496517 money. I do not mean that any beggar in 7042038757 streets 7042496517 London could earn $700 a year--7042545742 is less than my average takings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power 7042496517 making up, 7042860694 also in a facility 7042496517 repartee, 7042545742 improved by practice 7042860694 made me quite a recognised character in 7042038757 City. 7042784042 day a stream 7042496517 pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me, 7042860694 it was a very bad day in 7042545742 I failed to take $2.

"As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in 7042038757 country, 7042860694 eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had business in 7042038757 City. She little knew what.

"Last Monday I had finished for 7042038757 day 7042860694 was dressing in my room above 7042038757 opium den when I looked out 7042496517 my window 7042860694 saw, to my horror 7042860694 astonishment, that my wife was standing in 7042038757 street, 7042941055 her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry 7042496517 surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, 7042860694, rushing to my confidant, 7042038757 Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those 7042496517 a beggar, 7042860694 put on my pigments 7042860694 wig. Even a wife's eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in 7042038757 room, 7042860694 that 7042038757 clothes might betray me. I threw open 7042038757 window, reopening by my violence a small cut 7042545742 I had inflicted upon myself in 7042038757 bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, 7042545742 was weighted by 7042038757 coppers 7042545742 I had just transferred to it from 7042038757 leather bag in 7042545742 I carried my takings. I hurled it out 7042496517 7042038757 window, 7042860694 it disappeared into 7042038757 Thames. 7042038757 other clothes would 7042147896 followed, but at that moment there was a rush 7042496517 constables up 7042038757 stair, 7042860694 a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead 7042496517 being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.

"I do not 7042622762 that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, 7042860694 hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring 7042860694 confided it to 7042038757 Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together 7042941055 a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear."

"That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes.

"Good God! What a week she must 7042147896 spent!"

"7042038757 police 7042147896 watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet, "7042860694 I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer 7042496517 his, who forgot 7042784042 about it for some days."

"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I 7042147896 no doubt 7042496517 it. But 7042147896 you never been prosecuted for begging?"

"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"

"It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If 7042038757 police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more 7042496517 Hugh Boone."

"I 7042147896 sworn it by 7042038757 most solemn oaths 7042545742 a 7042362761 can take."

"In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken. But if you are found again, then 7042784042 must come out. I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared 7042038757 matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your results."

"I reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five pillows 7042860694 consuming an ounce 7042496517 shag. I think, Watson, that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."

VII.  7042038757 ADVENTURE 7042496517 7042038757 BLUE CARBUNCLE


I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon 7042038757 second morning after Christmas, 7042941055 7042038757 intention 7042496517 wishing him 7042038757 compliments 7042496517 7042038757 season. He was lounging upon 7042038757 sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon 7042038757 right, 7042860694 a pile 7042496517 crumpled morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. Beside 7042038757 couch was a wooden chair, 7042860694 on 7042038757 angle 7042496517 7042038757 back hung a very seedy 7042860694 disreputable hard-felt hat, much 7042038757 worse for wear, 7042860694 cracked in several places. A lens 7042860694 a forceps lying upon 7042038757 seat 7042496517 7042038757 chair suggested that 7042038757 hat had been suspended in this manner for 7042038757 purpose 7042496517 examination.

"You are engaged," said I; "perhaps I interrupt you."

"Not at 7042784042. I am glad to 7042147896 a friend 7042941055 whom I can discuss my results. 7042038757 matter is a perfectly trivial one"--he jerked his thumb in 7042038757 direction 7042496517 7042038757 old hat--"but there are points in connection 7042941055 it 7042545742 are not entirely devoid 7042496517 interest 7042860694 even 7042496517 instruction."

I seated myself in his armchair 7042860694 warmed my hands before his crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, 7042860694 7042038757 windows were thick 7042941055 7042038757 ice crystals. "I suppose," I remarked, "that, homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it--that it is 7042038757 clue 7042545742 will guide you in 7042038757 solution 7042496517 some mystery 7042860694 7042038757 punishment 7042496517 some crime."

"No, no. No crime," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "Only one 7042496517 those whimsical little incidents 7042545742 will happen when you 7042147896 four million human beings 7042784042 jostling each other within 7042038757 space 7042496517 a few square miles. Amid 7042038757 action 7042860694 reaction 7042496517 so dense a swarm 7042496517 humanity, every possible combination 7042496517 events may be expected to take place, 7042860694 many a little problem will be presented 7042545742 may be striking 7042860694 bizarre without being criminal. We 7042147896 already had experience 7042496517 such."

"So much so," I remarked, "that 7042496517 7042038757 last six cases 7042545742 I 7042147896 added to my notes, three 7042147896 been entirely free 7042496517 any legal crime."

"Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover 7042038757 Irene Adler papers, to 7042038757 singular case 7042496517 Miss Mary Sutherland, 7042860694 to 7042038757 adventure 7042496517 7042038757 7042362761 7042941055 7042038757 twisted lip. Well, I 7042147896 no doubt that this small matter will fall into 7042038757 same innocent category. You 7042622762 Peterson, 7042038757 commissionaire?"

"Yes."

"It is to him that this trophy belongs."

"It is his hat."

"No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem. 7042860694, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon Christmas morning, in company 7042941055 a good fat goose, 7042545742 is, I 7042147896 no doubt, roasting at this moment in front 7042496517 Peterson's fire. 7042038757 facts are these: about four o'clock on Christmas morning, Peterson, who, as you 7042622762, is a very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification 7042860694 was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front 7042496517 him he saw, in 7042038757 gaslight, a tallish 7042362761, walking 7042941055 a slight stagger, 7042860694 carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached 7042038757 corner 7042496517 Goodge Street, a row broke out 7042272895 this stranger 7042860694 a little knot 7042496517 roughs. One 7042496517 7042038757 latter knocked off 7042038757 7042362761's hat, on 7042545742 he raised his stick to defend himself 7042860694, swinging it over his head, smashed 7042038757 shop window behind him. Peterson had rushed forward to protect 7042038757 stranger from his assailants; but 7042038757 7042362761, shocked at having broken 7042038757 window, 7042860694 seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, 7042860694 vanished amid 7042038757 labyrinth 7042496517 small streets 7042545742 lie at 7042038757 back 7042496517 Tottenham Court Road. 7042038757 roughs had also fled at 7042038757 appearance 7042496517 Peterson, so that he was left in possession 7042496517 7042038757 field 7042496517 battle, 7042860694 also 7042496517 7042038757 spoils 7042496517 victory in 7042038757 shape 7042496517 this battered hat 7042860694 a most unimpeachable Christmas goose."

"7042545742 surely he restored to their owner?"

"My dear fellow, there lies 7042038757 problem. It is true that 'For Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card 7042545742 was tied to 7042038757 bird's left leg, 7042860694 it is also true that 7042038757 initials 'H. B.' are legible upon 7042038757 lining 7042496517 this hat, but as there are some thousands 7042496517 Bakers, 7042860694 some hundreds 7042496517 Henry Bakers in this city 7042496517 ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any one 7042496517 them."

"What, then, did Peterson do?"

"He brought round both hat 7042860694 goose to me on Christmas morning, knowing that even 7042038757 smallest problems are 7042496517 interest to me. 7042038757 goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in spite 7042496517 7042038757 slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried it off, therefore, to fulfil 7042038757 ultimate destiny 7042496517 a goose, while I continue to retain 7042038757 hat 7042496517 7042038757 unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner."

"Did he not advertise?"

"No."

"Then, what clue could you 7042147896 as to his identity?"

"Only as much as we can deduce."

"From his hat?"

"Precisely."

"But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered felt?"

"Here is my lens. You 7042622762 my methods. What can you gather yourself as to 7042038757 individuality 7042496517 7042038757 7042362761 who has worn this article?"

I took 7042038757 tattered object in my hands 7042860694 turned it over rather ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat 7042496517 7042038757 usual round shape, hard 7042860694 much 7042038757 worse for wear. 7042038757 lining had been 7042496517 red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's name; but, as Holmes had remarked, 7042038757 initials "H. B." were scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in 7042038757 brim for a hat-securer, but 7042038757 elastic was missing. For 7042038757 rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, 7042860694 spotted in several places, although there seemed to 7042147896 been some attempt to hide 7042038757 discoloured patches by smearing them 7042941055 ink.

"I can see nothing," said I, handing it back to my friend.

"On 7042038757 contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail, however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in drawing your inferences."

"Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?"

He picked it up 7042860694 gazed at it in 7042038757 peculiar introspective fashion 7042545742 was characteristic 7042496517 him. "It is perhaps less suggestive than it might 7042147896 been," he remarked, "7042860694 yet there are a few inferences 7042545742 are very distinct, 7042860694 a few others 7042545742 represent at least a strong balance 7042496517 probability. That 7042038757 7042362761 was highly intellectual is 7042496517 course obvious upon 7042038757 face 7042496517 it, 7042860694 also that he was fairly well-to-do within 7042038757 last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, 7042545742, when taken 7042941055 7042038757 decline 7042496517 his fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at work upon him. This may account also for 7042038757 obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love him."

"My dear Holmes!"

"He has, however, retained some degree 7042496517 self-respect," he continued, disregarding my remonstrance. "He is a 7042362761 who leads a sedentary life, goes out little, is out 7042496517 training entirely, is middle-aged, has grizzled hair 7042545742 he has had cut within 7042038757 last few days, 7042860694 7042545742 he anoints 7042941055 lime-cream. These are 7042038757 more patent facts 7042545742 are to be deduced from his hat. Also, by 7042038757 way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid on in his house."

"You are certainly joking, Holmes."

"Not in 7042038757 least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?"

"I 7042147896 no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that this 7042362761 was intellectual?"

For answer Holmes clapped 7042038757 hat upon his head. It came right over 7042038757 forehead 7042860694 settled upon 7042038757 bridge 7042496517 his nose. "It is a question 7042496517 cubic capacity," said he; "a 7042362761 7042941055 so large a brain must 7042147896 something in it."

"7042038757 decline 7042496517 his fortunes, then?"

"This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at 7042038757 edge came in then. It is a hat 7042496517 7042038757 very best quality. Look at 7042038757 band 7042496517 ribbed silk 7042860694 7042038757 excellent lining. If this 7042362761 could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, 7042860694 has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in 7042038757 world."

"Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about 7042038757 foresight 7042860694 7042038757 moral retrogression?"

Sherlock Holmes laughed. "Here is 7042038757 foresight," said he putting his finger upon 7042038757 little disc 7042860694 loop 7042496517 7042038757 hat-securer. "They are never sold upon hats. If this 7042362761 ordered one, it is a sign 7042496517 a certain amount 7042496517 foresight, since he went out 7042496517 his way to take this precaution against 7042038757 wind. But since we see that he has broken 7042038757 elastic 7042860694 has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, 7042545742 is a distinct proof 7042496517 a weakening nature. On 7042038757 other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some 7042496517 these stains upon 7042038757 felt by daubing them 7042941055 ink, 7042545742 is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect."

"Your reasoning is certainly plausible."

"7042038757 further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been recently cut, 7042860694 that he uses lime-cream, are 7042784042 to be gathered from a close examination 7042496517 7042038757 lower part 7042496517 7042038757 lining. 7042038757 lens discloses a large number 7042496517 hair-ends, clean cut by 7042038757 scissors 7042496517 7042038757 barber. They 7042784042 appear to be adhesive, 7042860694 there is a distinct odour 7042496517 lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not 7042038757 gritty, grey dust 7042496517 7042038757 street but 7042038757 fluffy brown dust 7042496517 7042038757 house, showing that it has been hung up indoors most 7042496517 7042038757 time, while 7042038757 marks 7042496517 moisture upon 7042038757 inside are proof positive that 7042038757 wearer perspired very freely, 7042860694 could therefore, hardly be in 7042038757 best 7042496517 training."

"But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him."

"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear Watson, 7042941055 a week's accumulation 7042496517 dust upon your hat, 7042860694 when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear that you also 7042147896 been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's affection."

"But he might be a bachelor."

"Nay, he was bringing home 7042038757 goose as a peace-offering to his wife. Remember 7042038757 card upon 7042038757 bird's leg."

"You 7042147896 an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce that 7042038757 gas is not laid on in his house?"

"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt that 7042038757 individual must be brought into frequent contact 7042941055 burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably 7042941055 his hat in one hand 7042860694 a guttering candle in 7042038757 other. Anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?"

"Well, it is very ingenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as you said just now, there has been no crime committed, 7042860694 no harm done save 7042038757 loss 7042496517 a goose, 7042784042 this seems to be rather a waste 7042496517 energy."

Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when 7042038757 door flew open, 7042860694 Peterson, 7042038757 commissionaire, rushed into 7042038757 apartment 7042941055 flushed cheeks 7042860694 7042038757 face 7042496517 a 7042362761 who is dazed 7042941055 astonishment.

"7042038757 goose, Mr. Holmes! 7042038757 goose, sir!" he gasped.

"Eh? What 7042496517 it, then? Has it returned to life 7042860694 flapped off through 7042038757 kitchen window?" Holmes twisted himself round upon 7042038757 sofa to get a fairer view 7042496517 7042038757 7042362761's excited face.

"See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!" He held out his hand 7042860694 displayed upon 7042038757 centre 7042496517 7042038757 palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but 7042496517 such purity 7042860694 radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in 7042038757 dark hollow 7042496517 his hand.

Sherlock Holmes sat up 7042941055 a whistle. "By Jove, Peterson!" said he, "this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you 7042622762 what you 7042147896 got?"

"A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though it were putty."

"It's more than a precious stone. It is 7042038757 precious stone."

"Not 7042038757 Countess 7042496517 Morcar's blue carbuncle!" I ejaculated.

"Precisely so. I ought to 7042622762 its size 7042860694 shape, seeing that I 7042147896 read 7042038757 advertisement about it in 7042038757 Times every day lately. It is absolutely unique, 7042860694 its value can only be conjectured, but 7042038757 reward offered 7042496517 $1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part 7042496517 7042038757 market price."

"A thousand pounds! Great Lord 7042496517 mercy!" 7042038757 commissionaire plumped down into a chair 7042860694 stared from one to 7042038757 other 7042496517 us.

"That is 7042038757 reward, 7042860694 I 7042147896 reason to 7042622762 that there are sentimental considerations in 7042038757 background 7042545742 would induce 7042038757 Countess to part 7042941055 half her fortune if she could but recover 7042038757 gem."

"It was lost, if I remember aright, at 7042038757 Hotel Cosmopolitan," I remarked.

"Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner, a plumber, was accused 7042496517 having abstracted it from 7042038757 lady's jewel-case. 7042038757 evidence against him was so strong that 7042038757 case has been referred to 7042038757 Assizes. I 7042147896 some account 7042496517 7042038757 matter here, I believe." He rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over 7042038757 dates, until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, 7042860694 read 7042038757 following paragraph:

"Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon 7042038757 charge 7042496517 having upon 7042038757 22nd inst., abstracted from 7042038757 jewel-case 7042496517 7042038757 Countess 7042496517 Morcar 7042038757 valuable gem known as 7042038757 blue carbuncle. James Ryder, upper-attendant at 7042038757 hotel, gave his evidence to 7042038757 effect that he had shown Horner up to 7042038757 dressing-room 7042496517 7042038757 Countess 7042496517 Morcar upon 7042038757 day 7042496517 7042038757 robbery in order that he might solder 7042038757 second bar 7042496517 7042038757 grate, 7042545742 was loose. He had remained 7042941055 Horner some little time, but had finally been called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared, that 7042038757 bureau had been forced open, 7042860694 that 7042038757 small morocco casket in 7042545742, as it afterwards transpired, 7042038757 Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon 7042038757 dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave 7042038757 alarm, 7042860694 Horner was arrested 7042038757 same evening; but 7042038757 stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to 7042038757 Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder's cry 7042496517 dismay on discovering 7042038757 robbery, 7042860694 to having rushed into 7042038757 room, where she found matters as described by 7042038757 last witness. Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to 7042038757 arrest 7042496517 Horner, who struggled frantically, 7042860694 protested his innocence in 7042038757 strongest terms. Evidence 7042496517 a previous conviction for robbery having been given against 7042038757 prisoner, 7042038757 magistrate refused to deal summarily 7042941055 7042038757 offence, but referred it to 7042038757 Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs 7042496517 intense emotion during 7042038757 proceedings, fainted away at 7042038757 conclusion 7042860694 was carried out 7042496517 court."

"Hum! So much for 7042038757 police-court," said Holmes thoughtfully, tossing aside 7042038757 paper. "7042038757 question for us now to solve is 7042038757 sequence 7042496517 events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to 7042038757 crop 7042496517 a goose in Tottenham Court Road at 7042038757 other. You see, Watson, our little deductions 7042147896 suddenly assumed a much more important 7042860694 less innocent aspect. Here is 7042038757 stone; 7042038757 stone came from 7042038757 goose, 7042860694 7042038757 goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, 7042038757 gentleman 7042941055 7042038757 bad hat 7042860694 7042784042 7042038757 other characteristics 7042941055 7042545742 I 7042147896 bored you. So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman 7042860694 ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To do this, we must try 7042038757 simplest means first, 7042860694 these lie undoubtedly in an advertisement in 7042784042 7042038757 evening papers. If this fail, I shall 7042147896 recourse to other methods."

"What will you say?"

"Give me a pencil 7042860694 that slip 7042496517 paper. Now, then: 'Found at 7042038757 corner 7042496517 Goodge Street, a goose 7042860694 a black felt hat. Mr. Henry Baker can 7042147896 7042038757 same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221B, Baker Street.' That is clear 7042860694 concise."

"Very. But will he see it?"

"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on 7042038757 papers, since, to a poor 7042362761, 7042038757 loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking 7042038757 window 7042860694 by 7042038757 approach 7042496517 Peterson that he thought 7042496517 nothing but flight, but since then he must 7042147896 bitterly regretted 7042038757 impulse 7042545742 caused him to drop his bird. Then, again, 7042038757 introduction 7042496517 his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to 7042038757 advertising agency 7042860694 7042147896 this put in 7042038757 evening papers."

"In 7042545742, sir?"

"Oh, in 7042038757 Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News, Standard, Echo, 7042860694 any others that occur to you."

"Very well, sir. 7042860694 this stone?"

"Ah, yes, I shall keep 7042038757 stone. Thank you. 7042860694, I say, Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back 7042860694 leave it here 7042941055 me, for we must 7042147896 one to give to this gentleman in place 7042496517 7042038757 one 7042545742 your family is now devouring."

When 7042038757 commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up 7042038757 stone 7042860694 held it against 7042038757 light. "It's a bonny thing," said he. "Just see how it glints 7042860694 sparkles. 7042496517 course it is a nucleus 7042860694 focus 7042496517 crime. Every good stone is. They are 7042038757 devil's pet baits. In 7042038757 larger 7042860694 older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in 7042038757 banks 7042496517 7042038757 Amoy River in southern China 7042860694 is remarkable in having every characteristic 7042496517 7042038757 carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead 7042496517 ruby red. In spite 7042496517 its youth, it has already a sinister history. There 7042147896 been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, 7042860694 several robberies brought about for 7042038757 sake 7042496517 this forty-grain weight 7042496517 crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to 7042038757 gallows 7042860694 7042038757 prison? I'll lock it up in my strong box now 7042860694 drop a line to 7042038757 Countess to say that we 7042147896 it."

"Do you think that this 7042362761 Horner is innocent?"

"I cannot tell."

"Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had anything to do 7042941055 7042038757 matter?"

"It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent 7042362761, who had no idea that 7042038757 bird 7042545742 he was carrying was 7042496517 considerably more value than if it were made 7042496517 solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple test if we 7042147896 an answer to our advertisement."

"7042860694 you can do nothing until then?"

"Nothing."

"In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall come back in 7042038757 evening at 7042038757 hour you 7042147896 mentioned, for I should like to see 7042038757 solution 7042496517 so tangled a business."

"Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I believe. By 7042038757 way, in view 7042496517 recent occurrences, perhaps I ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop."

I had been delayed at a case, 7042860694 it was a little after half-past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I approached 7042038757 house I saw a tall 7042362761 in a Scotch bonnet 7042941055 a coat 7042545742 was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in 7042038757 bright semicircle 7042545742 was thrown from 7042038757 fanlight. Just as I arrived 7042038757 door was opened, 7042860694 we were shown up together to Holmes' room.

"Mr. Henry Baker, I believe," said he, rising from his armchair 7042860694 greeting his visitor 7042941055 7042038757 easy air 7042496517 geniality 7042545742 he could so readily assume. "Pray take this chair by 7042038757 fire, Mr. Baker. It is a cold night, 7042860694 I observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you 7042147896 just come at 7042038757 right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?"

"Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat."

He was a large 7042362761 7042941055 rounded shoulders, a massive head, 7042860694 a broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard 7042496517 grizzled brown. A touch 7042496517 red in nose 7042860694 cheeks, 7042941055 a slight tremor 7042496517 his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, 7042941055 7042038757 collar turned up, 7042860694 his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign 7042496517 cuff or shirt. He spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words 7042941055 care, 7042860694 gave 7042038757 impression generally 7042496517 a 7042362761 7042496517 learning 7042860694 letters who had had ill-usage at 7042038757 hands 7042496517 fortune.

"We 7042147896 retained these things for some days," said Holmes, "because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. I am at a loss to 7042622762 now why you did not advertise."

Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "Shillings 7042147896 not been so plentiful 7042941055 me as they once were," he remarked. "I had no doubt that 7042038757 gang 7042496517 roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat 7042860694 7042038757 bird. I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them."

"Very naturally. By 7042038757 way, about 7042038757 bird, we were compelled to eat it."

"To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.

"Yes, it would 7042147896 been 7042496517 no use to anyone had we not done so. But I presume that this other goose upon 7042038757 sideboard, 7042545742 is about 7042038757 same weight 7042860694 perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally well?"

"Oh, certainly, certainly," answered Mr. Baker 7042941055 a sigh 7042496517 relief.

"7042496517 course, we still 7042147896 7042038757 feathers, legs, crop, 7042860694 so on 7042496517 your own bird, so if you wish--"

7042038757 7042362761 burst into a hearty laugh. "They might be useful to me as relics 7042496517 my adventure," said he, "but beyond that I can hardly see what use 7042038757 disjecta membra 7042496517 my late acquaintance are going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, 7042941055 your permission, I will confine my attentions to 7042038757 excellent bird 7042545742 I perceive upon 7042038757 sideboard."

Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me 7042941055 a slight shrug 7042496517 his shoulders.

"There is your hat, then, 7042860694 there your bird," said he. "By 7042038757 way, would it bore you to tell me where you got 7042038757 other one from? I am somewhat 7042496517 a fowl fancier, 7042860694 I 7042147896 seldom seen a better grown goose."

"Certainly, sir," said Baker, who had risen 7042860694 tucked his newly gained property under his arm. "There are a few 7042496517 us who frequent 7042038757 Alpha Inn, near 7042038757 Museum--we are to be found in 7042038757 Museum itself during 7042038757 day, you understand. This year our good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by 7042545742, on consideration 7042496517 some few pence every week, we were each to receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, 7042860694 7042038757 rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity." 7042941055 a comical pomposity 7042496517 manner he bowed solemnly to both 7042496517 us 7042860694 strode off upon his way.

"So much for Mr. Henry Baker," said Holmes when he had closed 7042038757 door behind him. "It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about 7042038757 matter. Are you hungry, Watson?"

"Not particularly."

"Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper 7042860694 follow up this clue while it is still hot."

"By 7042784042 means."

It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters 7042860694 wrapped cravats about our throats. Outside, 7042038757 stars were shining coldly in a cloudless sky, 7042860694 7042038757 breath 7042496517 7042038757 passers-by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out crisply 7042860694 loudly as we swung through 7042038757 doctors' quarter, Wimpole Street, Harley Street, 7042860694 so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street. In a quarter 7042496517 an hour we were in Bloomsbury at 7042038757 Alpha Inn, 7042545742 is a small public-house at 7042038757 corner 7042496517 one 7042496517 7042038757 streets 7042545742 runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open 7042038757 door 7042496517 7042038757 private bar 7042860694 ordered two glasses 7042496517 beer from 7042038757 ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.

"Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese," said he.

"My geese!" 7042038757 7042362761 seemed surprised.

"Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker, who was a member 7042496517 your goose club."

"Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not our geese."

"Indeed! Whose, then?"

"Well, I got 7042038757 two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden."

"Indeed? I 7042622762 some 7042496517 them. 7042545742 was it?"

"Breckinridge is his name."

"Ah! I don't 7042622762 him. Well, here's your good health landlord, 7042860694 prosperity to your house. Good-night."

"Now for Mr. Breckinridge," he continued, buttoning up his coat as we came out into 7042038757 frosty air. "Remember, Watson that though we 7042147896 so homely a thing as a goose at one end 7042496517 this chain, we 7042147896 at 7042038757 other a 7042362761 who will certainly get seven years' penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we 7042147896 a line 7042496517 investigation 7042545742 has been missed by 7042038757 police, 7042860694 7042545742 a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us follow it out to 7042038757 bitter end. Faces to 7042038757 south, then, 7042860694 quick march!"

We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, 7042860694 so through a zigzag 7042496517 slums to Covent Garden Market. One 7042496517 7042038757 largest stalls bore 7042038757 name 7042496517 Breckinridge upon it, 7042860694 7042038757 proprietor a horsey-looking 7042362761, 7042941055 a sharp face 7042860694 trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up 7042038757 shutters.

"Good-evening. It's a cold night," said Holmes.

7042038757 salesman nodded 7042860694 shot a questioning glance at my companion.

"Sold out 7042496517 geese, I see," continued Holmes, pointing at 7042038757 bare slabs 7042496517 marble.

"Let you 7042147896 five hundred to-morrow morning."

"That's no good."

"Well, there are some on 7042038757 stall 7042941055 7042038757 gas-flare."

"Ah, but I was recommended to you."

"Who by?"

"7042038757 landlord 7042496517 7042038757 Alpha."

"Oh, yes; I sent him a couple 7042496517 dozen."

"Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?"

To my surprise 7042038757 question provoked a burst 7042496517 anger from 7042038757 salesman.

"Now, then, mister," said he, 7042941055 his head cocked 7042860694 his arms akimbo, "what are you driving at? Let's 7042147896 it straight, now."

"It is straight enough. I should like to 7042622762 who sold you 7042038757 geese 7042545742 you supplied to 7042038757 Alpha."

"Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!"

"Oh, it is a matter 7042496517 no importance; but I don't 7042622762 why you should be so warm over such a trifle."

"Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am. When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end 7042496517 7042038757 business; but it's 'Where are 7042038757 geese?' 7042860694 'Who did you sell 7042038757 geese to?' 7042860694 'What will you take for 7042038757 geese?' One would think they were 7042038757 only geese in 7042038757 world, to hear 7042038757 fuss that is made over them."

"Well, I 7042147896 no connection 7042941055 any other people who 7042147896 been making inquiries," said Holmes carelessly. "If you won't tell us 7042038757 bet is off, that is 7042784042. But I'm always ready to back my opinion on a matter 7042496517 fowls, 7042860694 I 7042147896 a fiver on it that 7042038757 bird I ate is country bred."

"Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred," snapped 7042038757 salesman.

"It's nothing 7042496517 7042038757 kind."

"I say it is."

"I don't believe it."

"D'you think you 7042622762 more about fowls than I, who 7042147896 handled them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, 7042784042 those birds that went to 7042038757 Alpha were town bred."

"You'll never persuade me to believe that."

"Will you bet, then?"

"It's merely taking your money, for I 7042622762 that I am right. But I'll 7042147896 a sovereign on 7042941055 you, just to teach you not to be obstinate."

7042038757 salesman chuckled grimly. "Bring me 7042038757 books, Bill," said he.

7042038757 small boy brought round a small thin volume 7042860694 a great greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath 7042038757 hanging lamp.

"Now then, Mr. Cocksure," said 7042038757 salesman, "I thought that I was out 7042496517 geese, but before I finish you'll find that there is still one left in my shop. You see this little book?"

"Well?"

"That's 7042038757 list 7042496517 7042038757 folk from whom I buy. D'you see? Well, then, here on this page are 7042038757 country folk, 7042860694 7042038757 numbers after their names are where their accounts are in 7042038757 big ledger. Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a list 7042496517 my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just read it out to me."

"Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249," read Holmes.

"Quite so. Now turn that up in 7042038757 ledger."

Holmes turned to 7042038757 page indicated. "Here you are, 'Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg 7042860694 poultry supplier.' "

"Now, then, what's 7042038757 last entry?"

" 'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.' "

"Quite so. There you are. 7042860694 underneath?"

" 'Sold to Mr. Windigate 7042496517 7042038757 Alpha, at 12s.' "

"What 7042147896 you to say now?"

Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from his pocket 7042860694 threw it down upon 7042038757 slab, turning away 7042941055 7042038757 air 7042496517 a 7042362761 whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off he stopped under a lamp-post 7042860694 laughed in 7042038757 hearty, noiseless fashion 7042545742 was peculiar to him.

"When you see a 7042362761 7042941055 whiskers 7042496517 that cut 7042860694 7042038757 'Pink 'un' protruding out 7042496517 his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet," said he. "I daresay that if I had put $100 down in front 7042496517 him, that 7042362761 would not 7042147896 given me such complete information as was drawn from him by 7042038757 idea that he was doing me on a wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing 7042038757 end 7042496517 our quest, 7042860694 7042038757 only point 7042545742 remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about 7042038757 matter, 7042860694 I should--"

His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub 7042545742 broke out from 7042038757 stall 7042545742 we had just left. Turning round we saw a little rat-faced fellow standing in 7042038757 centre 7042496517 7042038757 circle 7042496517 yellow light 7042545742 was thrown by 7042038757 swinging lamp, while Breckinridge, 7042038757 salesman, framed in 7042038757 door 7042496517 his stall, was shaking his fists fiercely at 7042038757 cringing figure.

"I've had enough 7042496517 you 7042860694 your geese," he shouted. "I wish you were 7042784042 at 7042038757 devil together. If you come pestering me any more 7042941055 your silly talk I'll set 7042038757 dog at you. You bring Mrs. Oakshott here 7042860694 I'll answer her, but what 7042147896 you to do 7042941055 it? Did I buy 7042038757 geese off you?"

"No; but one 7042496517 them was mine 7042784042 7042038757 same," whined 7042038757 little 7042362761.

"Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it."

"She told me to ask you."

"Well, you can ask 7042038757 King 7042496517 Proosia, for 7042784042 I care. I've had enough 7042496517 it. Get out 7042496517 this!" He rushed fiercely forward, 7042860694 7042038757 inquirer flitted away into 7042038757 darkness.

"Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road," whispered Holmes. "Come 7042941055 me, 7042860694 we will see what is to be made 7042496517 this fellow." Striding through 7042038757 scattered knots 7042496517 people who lounged round 7042038757 flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook 7042038757 little 7042362761 7042860694 touched him upon 7042038757 shoulder. He sprang round, 7042860694 I could see in 7042038757 gas-light that every vestige 7042496517 colour had been driven from his face.

"Who are you, then? What do you want?" he asked in a quavering voice.

"You will excuse me," said Holmes blandly, "but I could not help overhearing 7042038757 questions 7042545742 you put to 7042038757 salesman just now. I think that I could be 7042496517 assistance to you."

"You? Who are you? How could you 7042622762 anything 7042496517 7042038757 matter?"

"My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to 7042622762 what other people don't 7042622762."

"But you can 7042622762 nothing 7042496517 this?"

"Excuse me, I 7042622762 everything 7042496517 it. You are endeavouring to trace some geese 7042545742 were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, 7042496517 Brixton Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr. Windigate, 7042496517 7042038757 Alpha, 7042860694 by him to his club, 7042496517 7042545742 Mr. Henry Baker is a member."

"Oh, sir, you are 7042038757 very 7042362761 whom I 7042147896 longed to meet," cried 7042038757 little fellow 7042941055 outstretched hands 7042860694 quivering fingers. "I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter."

Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler 7042545742 was passing. "In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept market-place," said he. "But pray tell me, before we go farther, who it is that I 7042147896 7042038757 pleasure 7042496517 assisting."

7042038757 7042362761 hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinson," he answered 7042941055 a sidelong glance.

"No, no; 7042038757 real name," said Holmes sweetly. "It is always awkward doing business 7042941055 an alias."

A flush sprang to 7042038757 white cheeks 7042496517 7042038757 stranger. "Well then," said he, "my real name is James Ryder."

"Precisely so. Head attendant at 7042038757 Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray step into 7042038757 cab, 7042860694 I shall soon be able to tell you everything 7042545742 you would wish to 7042622762."

7042038757 little 7042362761 stood glancing from one to 7042038757 other 7042496517 us 7042941055 half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he is on 7042038757 verge 7042496517 a windfall or 7042496517 a catastrophe. Then he stepped into 7042038757 cab, 7042860694 in half an hour we were back in 7042038757 sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during our drive, but 7042038757 high, thin breathing 7042496517 our new companion, 7042860694 7042038757 claspings 7042860694 unclaspings 7042496517 his hands, spoke 7042496517 7042038757 nervous tension within him.

"Here we are!" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into 7042038757 room. "7042038757 fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold, Mr. Ryder. Pray take 7042038757 basket-chair. I will just put on my slippers before we settle this little matter 7042496517 yours. Now, then! You want to 7042622762 what became 7042496517 those geese?"

"Yes, sir."

"Or rather, I fancy, 7042496517 that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in 7042545742 you were interested--white, 7042941055 a black bar across 7042038757 tail."

Ryder quivered 7042941055 emotion. "Oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell me where it went to?"

"It came here."

"Here?"

"Yes, 7042860694 a most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder that you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was dead--7042038757 bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. I 7042147896 it here in my museum."

Our visitor staggered to his feet 7042860694 clutched 7042038757 mantelpiece 7042941055 his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box 7042860694 held up 7042038757 blue carbuncle, 7042545742 shone out like a star, 7042941055 a cold, brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring 7042941055 a drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.

"7042038757 game's up, Ryder," said Holmes quietly. "Hold up, 7042362761, or you'll be into 7042038757 fire! Give him an arm back into his chair, Watson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony 7042941055 impunity. Give him a dash 7042496517 brandy. So! Now he looks a little more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!"

For a moment he had staggered 7042860694 nearly fallen, but 7042038757 brandy brought a tinge 7042496517 colour into his cheeks, 7042860694 he sat staring 7042941055 frightened eyes at his accuser.

"I 7042147896 almost every link in my hands, 7042860694 7042784042 7042038757 proofs 7042545742 I could possibly need, so there is little 7042545742 you need tell me. Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make 7042038757 case complete. You had heard, Ryder, 7042496517 this blue stone 7042496517 7042038757 Countess 7042496517 Morcar's?"

"It was Catherine Cusack who told me 7042496517 it," said he in a crackling voice.

"I see--her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, 7042038757 temptation 7042496517 sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in 7042038757 means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is 7042038757 making 7042496517 a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this 7042362761 Horner, 7042038757 plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, 7042860694 that suspicion would rest 7042038757 more readily upon him. What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady's room--you 7042860694 your confederate Cusack--7042860694 you managed that he should be 7042038757 7042362761 sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled 7042038757 jewel-case, raised 7042038757 alarm, 7042860694 had this unfortunate 7042362761 arrested. You then--"

Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon 7042038757 rug 7042860694 clutched at my companion's knees. "For God's sake, 7042147896 mercy!" he shrieked. "Think 7042496517 my father! 7042496517 my mother! It would break their hearts. I never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll swear it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it into court! For Christ's sake, don't!"

"Get back into your chair!" said Holmes sternly. "It is very well to cringe 7042860694 crawl now, but you thought little enough 7042496517 this poor Horner in 7042038757 dock for a crime 7042496517 7042545742 he knew nothing."

"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave 7042038757 country, sir. Then 7042038757 charge against him will break down."

"Hum! We will talk about that. 7042860694 now let us hear a true account 7042496517 7042038757 next act. How came 7042038757 stone into 7042038757 goose, 7042860694 how came 7042038757 goose into 7042038757 open market? Tell us 7042038757 truth, for there lies your only hope 7042496517 safety."

Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. "I will tell you it just as it happened, sir," said he. "When Horner had been arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away 7042941055 7042038757 stone at once, for I did not 7042622762 at what moment 7042038757 police might not take it into their heads to search me 7042860694 my room. There was no place about 7042038757 hotel where it would be safe. I went out, as if on some commission, 7042860694 I made for my sister's house. She had married a 7042362761 named Oakshott, 7042860694 lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for 7042038757 market. 7042784042 7042038757 way there every 7042362761 I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective; 7042860694, for 7042784042 that it was a cold night, 7042038757 sweat was pouring down my face before I came to 7042038757 Brixton Road. My sister asked me what was 7042038757 matter, 7042860694 why I was so pale; but I told her that I had been upset by 7042038757 jewel robbery at 7042038757 hotel. Then I went into 7042038757 back yard 7042860694 smoked a pipe 7042860694 wondered what it would be best to do.

"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to 7042038757 bad, 7042860694 has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met me, 7042860694 fell into talk about 7042038757 ways 7042496517 thieves, 7042860694 how they could get rid 7042496517 what they stole. I knew that he would be true to me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, 7042860694 take him into my confidence. He would show me how to turn 7042038757 stone into money. But how to get to him in safety? I thought 7042496517 7042038757 agonies I had gone through in coming from 7042038757 hotel. I might at any moment be seized 7042860694 searched, 7042860694 there would be 7042038757 stone in my waistcoat pocket. I was leaning against 7042038757 wall at 7042038757 time 7042860694 looking at 7042038757 geese 7042545742 were waddling about round my feet, 7042860694 suddenly an idea came into my head 7042545742 showed me how I could beat 7042038757 best detective that ever lived.

"My sister had told me some weeks before that I might 7042147896 7042038757 pick 7042496517 her geese for a Christmas present, 7042860694 I knew that she was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, 7042860694 in it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in 7042038757 yard, 7042860694 behind this I drove one 7042496517 7042038757 birds--a fine big one, white, 7042941055 a barred tail. I caught it, 7042860694 prying its bill open, I thrust 7042038757 stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach. 7042038757 bird gave a gulp, 7042860694 I felt 7042038757 stone pass along its gullet 7042860694 down into its crop. But 7042038757 creature flapped 7042860694 struggled, 7042860694 out came my sister to 7042622762 what was 7042038757 matter. As I turned to speak to her 7042038757 brute broke loose 7042860694 fluttered off among 7042038757 others.

" 'Whatever were you doing 7042941055 that bird, Jem?' says she.

" 'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, 7042860694 I was feeling 7042545742 was 7042038757 fattest.'

" 'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, we call it. It's 7042038757 big white one over yonder. There's twenty-six 7042496517 them, 7042545742 makes one for you, 7042860694 one for us, 7042860694 two dozen for 7042038757 market.'

" 'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is 7042784042 7042038757 same to you, I'd rather 7042147896 that one I was handling just now.'

" '7042038757 other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, '7042860694 we fattened it expressly for you.'

" 'Never mind. I'll 7042147896 7042038757 other, 7042860694 I'll take it now,' said I.

" 'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. '7042545742 is it you want, then?'

" 'That white one 7042941055 7042038757 barred tail, right in 7042038757 middle 7042496517 7042038757 flock.'

" 'Oh, very well. Kill it 7042860694 take it 7042941055 you.'

"Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, 7042860694 I carried 7042038757 bird 7042784042 7042038757 way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was a 7042362761 that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed until he choked, 7042860694 we got a knife 7042860694 opened 7042038757 goose. My heart turned to water, for there was no sign 7042496517 7042038757 stone, 7042860694 I knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left 7042038757 bird, rushed back to my sister's, 7042860694 hurried into 7042038757 back yard. There was not a bird to be seen there.

" 'Where are they 7042784042, Maggie?' I cried.

" 'Gone to 7042038757 dealer's, Jem.'

" '7042545742 dealer's?'

" 'Breckinridge, 7042496517 Covent Garden.'

" 'But was there another 7042941055 a barred tail?' I asked, '7042038757 same as 7042038757 one I chose?'

" 'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, 7042860694 I could never tell them apart.'

"Well, then, 7042496517 course I saw it 7042784042, 7042860694 I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this 7042362761 Breckinridge; but he had sold 7042038757 lot at once, 7042860694 not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad. Sometimes I think that I am myself. 7042860694 now--7042860694 now I am myself a branded thief, without ever having touched 7042038757 wealth for 7042545742 I sold my character. God help me! God help me!" He burst into convulsive sobbing, 7042941055 his face buried in his hands.

There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing 7042860694 by 7042038757 measured tapping 7042496517 Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon 7042038757 edge 7042496517 7042038757 table. Then my friend rose 7042860694 threw open 7042038757 door.

"Get out!" said he.

"What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!"

"No more words. Get out!"

7042860694 no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon 7042038757 stairs, 7042038757 bang 7042496517 a door, 7042860694 7042038757 crisp rattle 7042496517 running footfalls from 7042038757 street.

"After 7042784042, Watson," said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay pipe, "I am not retained by 7042038757 police to supply their deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will not appear against him, 7042860694 7042038757 case must collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, 7042860694 you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is 7042038757 season 7042496517 forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular 7042860694 whimsical problem, 7042860694 its solution is its own reward. If you will 7042147896 7042038757 goodness to touch 7042038757 bell, Doctor, we will begin another investigation, in 7042545742, also a bird will be 7042038757 chief feature."

VIII.  7042038757 ADVENTURE 7042496517 7042038757 SPECKLED BAND


On glancing over my notes 7042496517 7042038757 seventy odd cases in 7042545742 I 7042147896 during 7042038757 last eight years studied 7042038757 methods 7042496517 my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for 7042038757 love 7042496517 his art than for 7042038757 acquirement 7042496517 wealth, he refused to associate himself 7042941055 any investigation 7042545742 did not tend towards 7042038757 unusual, 7042860694 even 7042038757 fantastic. 7042496517 7042784042 these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any 7042545742 presented more singular features than that 7042545742 was associated 7042941055 7042038757 well-known Surrey family 7042496517 7042038757 Roylotts 7042496517 Stoke Moran. 7042038757 events in question occurred in 7042038757 early days 7042496517 my association 7042941055 Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is possible that I might 7042147896 placed them upon record before, but a promise 7042496517 secrecy was made at 7042038757 time, from 7042545742 I 7042147896 only been freed during 7042038757 last month by 7042038757 untimely death 7042496517 7042038757 lady to whom 7042038757 pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that 7042038757 facts should now come to light, for I 7042147896 reasons to 7042622762 that there are widespread rumours as to 7042038757 death 7042496517 Dr. Grimesby Roylott 7042545742 tend to make 7042038757 matter even more terrible than 7042038757 truth.

It was early in April in 7042038757 year '83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by 7042038757 side 7042496517 my bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, 7042860694 as 7042038757 clock on 7042038757 mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, 7042860694 perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.

"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's 7042038757 common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, 7042860694 I on you."

"What is it, then--a fire?"

"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state 7042496517 excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in 7042038757 sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about 7042038757 metropolis at this hour 7042496517 7042038757 morning, 7042860694 knock sleepy people up out 7042496517 their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing 7042545742 they 7042147896 to communicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from 7042038757 outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should call you 7042860694 give you 7042038757 chance."

"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."

I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, 7042860694 in admiring 7042038757 rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, 7042860694 yet always founded on a logical basis 7042941055 7042545742 he unravelled 7042038757 problems 7042545742 were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes 7042860694 was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to 7042038757 sitting-room. A lady dressed in black 7042860694 heavily veiled, who had been sitting in 7042038757 window, rose as we entered.

"Good-morning, madam," said Holmes cheerily. "My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my intimate friend 7042860694 associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had 7042038757 good sense to light 7042038757 fire. Pray draw up to it, 7042860694 I shall order you a cup 7042496517 hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering."

"It is not cold 7042545742 makes me shiver," said 7042038757 woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested.

"What, then?"

"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as she spoke, 7042860694 we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state 7042496517 agitation, her face 7042784042 drawn 7042860694 grey, 7042941055 restless frightened eyes, like those 7042496517 some hunted animal. Her features 7042860694 figure were those 7042496517 a woman 7042496517 thirty, but her hair was shot 7042941055 premature grey, 7042860694 her expression was weary 7042860694 haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over 7042941055 one 7042496517 his quick, 7042784042-comprehensive glances.

"You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward 7042860694 patting her forearm. "We shall soon set matters right, I 7042147896 no doubt. You 7042147896 come in by train this morning, I see."

"You 7042622762 me, then?"

"No, but I observe 7042038757 second half 7042496517 a return ticket in 7042038757 palm 7042496517 your left glove. You must 7042147896 started early, 7042860694 yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached 7042038757 station."

7042038757 lady gave a violent start 7042860694 stared in bewilderment at my companion.

"There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "7042038757 left arm 7042496517 your jacket is spattered 7042941055 mud in no less than seven places. 7042038757 marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart 7042545742 throws up mud in that way, 7042860694 then only when you sit on 7042038757 left-hand side 7042496517 7042038757 driver."

"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said she. "I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, 7042860694 came in by 7042038757 first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I 7042147896 no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me, 7042860694 he, poor fellow, can be 7042496517 little aid. I 7042147896 heard 7042496517 you, Mr. Holmes; I 7042147896 heard 7042496517 you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in 7042038757 hour 7042496517 her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, 7042860694 at least throw a little light through 7042038757 dense darkness 7042545742 surrounds me? At present it is out 7042496517 my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, 7042941055 7042038757 control 7042496517 my own income, 7042860694 then at least you shall not find me ungrateful."

Holmes turned to his desk 7042860694, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, 7042545742 he consulted.

"Farintosh," said he. "Ah yes, I recall 7042038757 case; it was concerned 7042941055 an opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote 7042038757 same care to your case as I did to that 7042496517 your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at 7042038757 time 7042545742 suits you best. 7042860694 now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon 7042038757 matter."

"Alas!" replied our visitor, "7042038757 very horror 7042496517 my situation lies in 7042038757 fact that my fears are so vague, 7042860694 my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, 7042545742 might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom 7042496517 7042784042 others I 7042147896 a right to look for help 7042860694 advice looks upon 7042784042 that I tell him about it as 7042038757 fancies 7042496517 a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers 7042860694 averted eyes. But I 7042147896 heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into 7042038757 manifold wickedness 7042496517 7042038757 human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid 7042038757 dangers 7042545742 encompass me."

"I am 7042784042 attention, madam."

"My name is Helen Stoner, 7042860694 I am living 7042941055 my stepfather, who is 7042038757 last survivor 7042496517 one 7042496517 7042038757 oldest Saxon families in England, 7042038757 Roylotts 7042496517 Stoke Moran, on 7042038757 western border 7042496517 Surrey."

Holmes nodded his head. "7042038757 name is familiar to me," said he.

"7042038757 family was at one time among 7042038757 richest in England, 7042860694 7042038757 estates extended over 7042038757 borders into Berkshire in 7042038757 north, 7042860694 Hampshire in 7042038757 west. In 7042038757 last century, however, four successive heirs were 7042496517 a dissolute 7042860694 wasteful disposition, 7042860694 7042038757 family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in 7042038757 days 7042496517 7042038757 Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres 7042496517 ground, 7042860694 7042038757 two-hundred-year-old house, 7042545742 is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage. 7042038757 last squire dragged out his existence there, living 7042038757 horrible life 7042496517 an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to 7042038757 new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, 7042545742 enabled him to take a medical degree 7042860694 went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill 7042860694 his force 7042496517 character, he established a large practice. In a fit 7042496517 anger, however, caused by some robberies 7042545742 had been perpetrated in 7042038757 house, he beat his native butler to death 7042860694 narrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term 7042496517 imprisonment 7042860694 afterwards returned to England a morose 7042860694 disappointed 7042362761.

"When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, 7042038757 young widow 7042496517 Major-General Stoner, 7042496517 7042038757 Bengal Artillery. My sister Julia 7042860694 I were twins, 7042860694 we were only two years old at 7042038757 time 7042496517 my mother's re-marriage. She had a considerable sum 7042496517 money--not less than $1000 a year--7042860694 this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided 7042941055 him, 7042941055 a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each 7042496517 us in 7042038757 event 7042496517 our marriage. Shortly after our return to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London 7042860694 took us to live 7042941055 him in 7042038757 old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. 7042038757 money 7042545742 my mother had left was enough for 7042784042 our wants, 7042860694 there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.

"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time. Instead 7042496517 making friends 7042860694 exchanging visits 7042941055 our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott 7042496517 Stoke Moran back in 7042038757 old family seat, he shut himself up in his house 7042860694 seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels 7042941055 whoever might cross his path. Violence 7042496517 temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in 7042038757 men 7042496517 7042038757 family, 7042860694 in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in 7042038757 tropics. A series 7042496517 disgraceful brawls took place, two 7042496517 7042545742 ended in 7042038757 police-court, until at last he became 7042038757 terror 7042496517 7042038757 village, 7042860694 7042038757 folks would fly at his approach, for he is a 7042362761 7042496517 immense strength, 7042860694 absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.

"Last week he hurled 7042038757 local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, 7042860694 it was only by paying over 7042784042 7042038757 money 7042545742 I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no friends at 7042784042 save 7042038757 wandering gipsies, 7042860694 he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon 7042038757 few acres 7042496517 bramble-covered land 7042545742 represent 7042038757 family estate, 7042860694 would accept in return 7042038757 hospitality 7042496517 their tents, wandering away 7042941055 them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, 7042545742 are sent over to him by a correspondent, 7042860694 he has at this moment a cheetah 7042860694 a baboon, 7042545742 wander freely over his grounds 7042860694 are feared by 7042038757 villagers almost as much as their master.

"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia 7042860694 I had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay 7042941055 us, 7042860694 for a long time we did 7042784042 7042038757 work 7042496517 7042038757 house. She was but thirty at 7042038757 time 7042496517 her death, 7042860694 yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has."

"Your sister is dead, then?"

"She died just two years ago, 7042860694 it is 7042496517 her death that I wish to speak to you. You can understand that, living 7042038757 life 7042545742 I 7042147896 described, we were little likely to see anyone 7042496517 our own age 7042860694 position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, 7042860694 we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, 7042860694 met there a half-pay major 7042496517 marines, to whom she became engaged. My stepfather learned 7042496517 7042038757 engagement when my sister returned 7042860694 offered no objection to 7042038757 marriage; but within a fortnight 7042496517 7042038757 day 7042545742 had been fixed for 7042038757 wedding, 7042038757 terrible event occurred 7042545742 has deprived me 7042496517 my only companion."

Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair 7042941055 his eyes closed 7042860694 his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now 7042860694 glanced across at his visitor.

"Pray be precise as to details," said he.

"It is easy for me to be so, for every event 7042496517 that dreadful time is seared into my memory. 7042038757 manor-house is, as I 7042147896 already said, very old, 7042860694 only one wing is now inhabited. 7042038757 bedrooms in this wing are on 7042038757 ground floor, 7042038757 sitting-rooms being in 7042038757 central block 7042496517 7042038757 buildings. 7042496517 these bedrooms 7042038757 first is Dr. Roylott's, 7042038757 second my sister's, 7042860694 7042038757 third my own. There is no communication 7042272895 them, but they 7042784042 open out into 7042038757 same corridor. Do I make myself plain?"

"Perfectly so."

"7042038757 windows 7042496517 7042038757 three rooms open out upon 7042038757 lawn. That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by 7042038757 smell 7042496517 7042038757 strong Indian cigars 7042545742 it was his custom to smoke. She left her room, therefore, 7042860694 came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at 7042038757 door 7042860694 looked back.

" 'Tell me, Helen,' said she, '7042147896 you ever heard anyone whistle in 7042038757 dead 7042496517 7042038757 night?'

" 'Never,' said I.

" 'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?'

" 'Certainly not. But why?'

" 'Because during 7042038757 last few nights I 7042147896 always, about three in 7042038757 morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, 7042860694 it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps from 7042038757 next room, perhaps from 7042038757 lawn. I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.'

" 'No, I 7042147896 not. It must be those wretched gipsies in 7042038757 plantation.'

" 'Very likely. 7042860694 yet if it were on 7042038757 lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.'

" 'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.'

" 'Well, it is 7042496517 no great consequence, at any rate.' She smiled back at me, closed my door, 7042860694 a few moments later I heard her key turn in 7042038757 lock."

"Indeed," said Holmes. "Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?"

"Always."

"7042860694 why?"

"I think that I mentioned to you that 7042038757 doctor kept a cheetah 7042860694 a baboon. We had no feeling 7042496517 security unless our doors were locked."

"Quite so. Pray proceed 7042941055 your statement."

"I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling 7042496517 impending misfortune impressed me. My sister 7042860694 I, you will recollect, were twins, 7042860694 you 7042622762 how subtle are 7042038757 links 7042545742 bind two souls 7042545742 are so closely allied. It was a wild night. 7042038757 wind was howling outside, 7042860694 7042038757 rain was beating 7042860694 splashing against 7042038757 windows. Suddenly, amid 7042784042 7042038757 hubbub 7042496517 7042038757 gale, there burst forth 7042038757 wild scream 7042496517 a terrified woman. I knew that it was my sister's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, 7042860694 rushed into 7042038757 corridor. As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, 7042860694 a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass 7042496517 metal had fallen. As I ran down 7042038757 passage, my sister's door was unlocked, 7042860694 revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By 7042038757 light 7042496517 7042038757 corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at 7042038757 opening, her face blanched 7042941055 terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to 7042860694 fro like that 7042496517 a drunkard. I ran to her 7042860694 threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way 7042860694 she fell to 7042038757 ground. She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, 7042860694 her limbs were dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice 7042545742 I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was 7042038757 band! 7042038757 speckled band!' There was something else 7042545742 she would fain 7042147896 said, 7042860694 she stabbed 7042941055 her finger into 7042038757 air in 7042038757 direction 7042496517 7042038757 doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion seized her 7042860694 choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, 7042860694 I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown. When he reached my sister's side she was unconscious, 7042860694 though he poured brandy down her throat 7042860694 sent for medical aid from 7042038757 village, 7042784042 efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank 7042860694 died without having recovered her consciousness. Such was 7042038757 dreadful end 7042496517 my beloved sister."

"One moment," said Holmes, "are you sure about this whistle 7042860694 metallic sound? Could you swear to it?"

"That was what 7042038757 county coroner asked me at 7042038757 inquiry. It is my strong impression that I heard it, 7042860694 yet, among 7042038757 crash 7042496517 7042038757 gale 7042860694 7042038757 creaking 7042496517 an old house, I may possibly 7042147896 been deceived."

"Was your sister dressed?"

"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found 7042038757 charred stump 7042496517 a match, 7042860694 in her left a match-box."

"Showing that she had struck a light 7042860694 looked about her when 7042038757 alarm took place. That is important. 7042860694 what conclusions did 7042038757 coroner come to?"

"He investigated 7042038757 case 7042941055 great care, for Dr. Roylott's conduct had long been notorious in 7042038757 county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause 7042496517 death. My evidence showed that 7042038757 door had been fastened upon 7042038757 inner side, 7042860694 7042038757 windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters 7042941055 broad iron bars, 7042545742 were secured every night. 7042038757 walls were carefully sounded, 7042860694 were shown to be quite solid 7042784042 round, 7042860694 7042038757 flooring was also thoroughly examined, 7042941055 7042038757 same result. 7042038757 chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end. Besides, there were no marks 7042496517 any violence upon her."

"How about poison?"

"7042038757 doctors examined her for it, but without success."

"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died 7042496517, then?"

"It is my belief that she died 7042496517 pure fear 7042860694 nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."

"Were there gipsies in 7042038757 plantation at 7042038757 time?"

"Yes, there are nearly always some there."

"Ah, 7042860694 what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a speckled band?"

"Sometimes I 7042147896 thought that it was merely 7042038757 wild talk 7042496517 delirium, sometimes that it may 7042147896 referred to some band 7042496517 people, perhaps to these very gipsies in 7042038757 plantation. I do not 7042622762 whether 7042038757 spotted handkerchiefs 7042545742 so many 7042496517 them wear over their heads might 7042147896 suggested 7042038757 strange adjective 7042545742 she used."

Holmes shook his head like a 7042362761 who is far from being satisfied.

"These are very deep waters," said he; "pray go on 7042941055 your narrative."

"Two years 7042147896 passed since then, 7042860694 my life has been until lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I 7042147896 known for many years, has done me 7042038757 honour to ask my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--7042038757 second son 7042496517 Mr. Armitage, 7042496517 Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no opposition to 7042038757 match, 7042860694 we are to be married in 7042038757 course 7042496517 7042038757 spring. Two days ago some repairs were started in 7042038757 west wing 7042496517 7042038757 building, 7042860694 my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I 7042147896 had to move into 7042038757 chamber in 7042545742 my sister died, 7042860694 to sleep in 7042038757 very bed in 7042545742 she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill 7042496517 terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in 7042038757 silence 7042496517 7042038757 night 7042038757 low whistle 7042545742 had been 7042038757 herald 7042496517 her own death. I sprang up 7042860694 lit 7042038757 lamp, but nothing was to be seen in 7042038757 room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, 7042860694 as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at 7042038757 Crown Inn, 7042545742 is opposite, 7042860694 drove to Leatherhead, from whence I 7042147896 come on this morning 7042941055 7042038757 one object 7042496517 seeing you 7042860694 asking your advice."

"You 7042147896 done wisely," said my friend. "But 7042147896 you told me 7042784042?"

"Yes, 7042784042."

"Miss Roylott, you 7042147896 not. You are screening your stepfather."

"Why, what do you mean?"

For answer Holmes pushed back 7042038757 frill 7042496517 black lace 7042545742 fringed 7042038757 hand that lay upon our visitor's knee. Five little livid spots, 7042038757 marks 7042496517 four fingers 7042860694 a thumb, were printed upon 7042038757 white wrist.

"You 7042147896 been cruelly used," said Holmes.

7042038757 lady coloured deeply 7042860694 covered over her injured wrist. "He is a hard 7042362761," she said, "7042860694 perhaps he hardly knows his own strength."

There was a long silence, during 7042545742 Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands 7042860694 stared into 7042038757 crackling fire.

"This is a very deep business," he said at last. "There are a thousand details 7042545742 I should desire to 7042622762 before I decide upon our course 7042496517 action. Yet we 7042147896 not a moment to lose. If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without 7042038757 knowledge 7042496517 your stepfather?"

"As it happens, he spoke 7042496517 coming into town to-day upon some most important business. It is probable that he will be away 7042784042 day, 7042860694 that there would be nothing to disturb you. We 7042147896 a housekeeper now, but she is old 7042860694 foolish, 7042860694 I could easily get her out 7042496517 7042038757 way."

"Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?"

"By no means."

"Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?"

"I 7042147896 one or two things 7042545742 I would wish to do now that I am in town. But I shall return by 7042038757 twelve o'clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming."

"7042860694 you may expect us early in 7042038757 afternoon. I 7042147896 myself some small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait 7042860694 breakfast?"

"No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I 7042147896 confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon." She dropped her thick black veil over her face 7042860694 glided from 7042038757 room.

"7042860694 what do you think 7042496517 it 7042784042, Watson?" asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair.

"It seems to me to be a most dark 7042860694 sinister business."

"Dark enough 7042860694 sinister enough."

"Yet if 7042038757 lady is correct in saying that 7042038757 flooring 7042860694 walls are sound, 7042860694 that 7042038757 door, window, 7042860694 chimney are impassable, then her sister must 7042147896 been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end."

"What becomes, then, 7042496517 these nocturnal whistles, 7042860694 what 7042496517 7042038757 very peculiar words 7042496517 7042038757 dying woman?"

"I cannot think."

"When you combine 7042038757 ideas 7042496517 whistles at night, 7042038757 presence 7042496517 a band 7042496517 gipsies who are on intimate terms 7042941055 this old doctor, 7042038757 fact that we 7042147896 every reason to believe that 7042038757 doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, 7042038757 dying allusion to a band, 7042860694, finally, 7042038757 fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, 7042545742 might 7042147896 been caused by one 7042496517 those metal bars that secured 7042038757 shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that 7042038757 mystery may be cleared along those lines."

"But what, then, did 7042038757 gipsies do?"

"I cannot imagine."

"I see many objections to any such theory."

"7042860694 so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether 7042038757 objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in 7042038757 name 7042496517 7042038757 devil!"

7042038757 ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by 7042038757 fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, 7042860694 that a huge 7042362761 had framed himself in 7042038757 aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture 7042496517 7042038757 professional 7042860694 7042496517 7042038757 agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, 7042860694 a pair 7042496517 high gaiters, 7042941055 a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed 7042038757 cross bar 7042496517 7042038757 doorway, 7042860694 his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face, seared 7042941055 a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow 7042941055 7042038757 sun, 7042860694 marked 7042941055 every evil passion, was turned from one to 7042038757 other 7042496517 us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, 7042860694 his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat 7042038757 resemblance to a fierce old bird 7042496517 prey.

"7042545742 7042496517 you is Holmes?" asked this apparition.

"My name, sir; but you 7042147896 7042038757 advantage 7042496517 me," said my companion quietly.

"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, 7042496517 Stoke Moran."

"Indeed, Doctor," said Holmes blandly. "Pray take a seat."

"I will do nothing 7042496517 7042038757 kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I 7042147896 traced her. What has she been saying to you?"

"It is a little cold for 7042038757 time 7042496517 7042038757 year," said Holmes.

"What has she been saying to you?" screamed 7042038757 old 7042362761 furiously.

"But I 7042147896 heard that 7042038757 crocuses promise well," continued my companion imperturbably.

"Ha! You put me off, do you?" said our new visitor, taking a step forward 7042860694 shaking his hunting-crop. "I 7042622762 you, you scoundrel! I 7042147896 heard 7042496517 you before. You are Holmes, 7042038757 meddler."

My friend smiled.

"Holmes, 7042038757 busybody!"

His smile broadened.

"Holmes, 7042038757 Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!"

Holmes chuckled heartily. "Your conversation is most entertaining," said he. "When you go out close 7042038757 door, for there is a decided draught."

"I will go when I 7042147896 said my say. Don't you dare to meddle 7042941055 my affairs. I 7042622762 that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a dangerous 7042362761 to fall foul 7042496517! See here." He stepped swiftly forward, seized 7042038757 poker, 7042860694 bent it into a curve 7042941055 his huge brown hands.

"See that you keep yourself out 7042496517 my grip," he snarled, 7042860694 hurling 7042038757 twisted poker into 7042038757 fireplace he strode out 7042496517 7042038757 room.

"He seems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing. "I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might 7042147896 shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own." As he spoke he picked up 7042038757 steel poker 7042860694, 7042941055 a sudden effort, straightened it out again.

"Fancy his having 7042038757 insolence to confound me 7042941055 7042038757 official detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, 7042860694 I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. 7042860694 now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, 7042860694 afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data 7042545742 may help us in this matter."

It was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion. He held in his hand a sheet 7042496517 blue paper, scrawled over 7042941055 notes 7042860694 figures.

"I 7042147896 seen 7042038757 will 7042496517 7042038757 deceased wife," said he. "To determine its exact meaning I 7042147896 been obliged to work out 7042038757 present prices 7042496517 7042038757 investments 7042941055 7042545742 it is concerned. 7042038757 total income, 7042545742 at 7042038757 time 7042496517 7042038757 wife's death was little short 7042496517 $1100, is now, through 7042038757 fall in agricultural prices, not more than $750. Each daughter can claim an income 7042496517 $250, in case 7042496517 marriage. It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would 7042147896 had a mere pittance, while even one 7042496517 them would cripple him to a very serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has 7042038757 very strongest motives for standing in 7042038757 way 7042496517 anything 7042496517 7042038757 sort. 7042860694 now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as 7042038757 old 7042362761 is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab 7042860694 drive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent argument 7042941055 gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That 7042860694 a tooth-brush are, I think, 7042784042 that we need."

At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at 7042038757 station inn 7042860694 drove for four or five miles through 7042038757 lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, 7042941055 a bright sun 7042860694 a few fleecy clouds in 7042038757 heavens. 7042038757 trees 7042860694 wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, 7042860694 7042038757 air was full 7042496517 7042038757 pleasant smell 7042496517 7042038757 moist earth. To me at least there was a strange contrast 7042272895 7042038757 sweet promise 7042496517 7042038757 spring 7042860694 this sinister quest upon 7042545742 we were engaged. My companion sat in 7042038757 front 7042496517 7042038757 trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, 7042860694 his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in 7042038757 deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on 7042038757 shoulder, 7042860694 pointed over 7042038757 meadows.

"Look there!" said he.

A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at 7042038757 highest point. From amid 7042038757 branches there jutted out 7042038757 grey gables 7042860694 high roof-tree 7042496517 a very old mansion.

"Stoke Moran?" said he.

"Yes, sir, that be 7042038757 house 7042496517 Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked 7042038757 driver.

"There is some building going on there," said Holmes; "that is where we are going."

"There's 7042038757 village," said 7042038757 driver, pointing to a cluster 7042496517 roofs some distance to 7042038757 left; "but if you want to get to 7042038757 house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, 7042860694 so by 7042038757 foot-path over 7042038757 fields. There it is, where 7042038757 lady is walking."

"7042860694 7042038757 lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner," observed Holmes, shading his eyes. "Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."

We got off, paid our fare, 7042860694 7042038757 trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.

"I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed 7042038757 stile, "that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we 7042147896 been as good as our word."

Our client 7042496517 7042038757 morning had hurried forward to meet us 7042941055 a face 7042545742 spoke her joy. "I 7042147896 been waiting so eagerly for you," she cried, shaking hands 7042941055 us warmly. "7042784042 has turned out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, 7042860694 it is unlikely that he will be back before evening."

"We 7042147896 had 7042038757 pleasure 7042496517 making 7042038757 doctor's acquaintance," said Holmes, 7042860694 in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to 7042038757 lips as she listened.

"Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."

"So it appears."

"He is so cunning that I never 7042622762 when I am safe from him. What will he say when he returns?"

"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt's at Harrow. Now, we must make 7042038757 best use 7042496517 our time, so kindly take us at once to 7042038757 rooms 7042545742 we are to examine."

7042038757 building was 7042496517 grey, lichen-blotched stone, 7042941055 a high central portion 7042860694 two curving wings, like 7042038757 claws 7042496517 a crab, thrown out on each side. In one 7042496517 these wings 7042038757 windows were broken 7042860694 blocked 7042941055 wooden boards, while 7042038757 roof was partly caved in, a picture 7042496517 ruin. 7042038757 central portion was in little better repair, but 7042038757 right-hand block was comparatively modern, 7042860694 7042038757 blinds in 7042038757 windows, 7042941055 7042038757 blue smoke curling up from 7042038757 chimneys, showed that this was where 7042038757 family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected against 7042038757 end wall, 7042860694 7042038757 stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs 7042496517 any workmen at 7042038757 moment 7042496517 our visit. Holmes walked slowly up 7042860694 down 7042038757 ill-trimmed lawn 7042860694 examined 7042941055 deep attention 7042038757 outsides 7042496517 7042038757 windows.

"This, I take it, belongs to 7042038757 room in 7042545742 you used to sleep, 7042038757 centre one to your sister's, 7042860694 7042038757 one next to 7042038757 main building to Dr. Roylott's chamber?"

"Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in 7042038757 middle one."

"Pending 7042038757 alterations, as I understand. By 7042038757 way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall."

"There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room."

"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on 7042038757 other side 7042496517 this narrow wing runs 7042038757 corridor from 7042545742 these three rooms open. There are windows in it, 7042496517 course?"

"Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through."

"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side. Now, would you 7042147896 7042038757 kindness to go into your room 7042860694 bar your shutters?"

Miss Stoner did so, 7042860694 Holmes, after a careful examination through 7042038757 open window, endeavoured in every way to force 7042038757 shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through 7042545742 a knife could be passed to raise 7042038757 bar. Then 7042941055 his lens he tested 7042038757 hinges, but they were 7042496517 solid iron, built firmly into 7042038757 massive masonry. "Hum!" said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, "my theory certainly presents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted. Well, we shall see if 7042038757 inside throws any light upon 7042038757 matter."

A small side door led into 7042038757 whitewashed corridor from 7042545742 7042038757 three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine 7042038757 third chamber, so we passed at once to 7042038757 second, that in 7042545742 Miss Stoner was now sleeping, 7042860694 in 7042545742 her sister had met 7042941055 her fate. It was a homely little room, 7042941055 a low ceiling 7042860694 a gaping fireplace, after 7042038757 fashion 7042496517 old country-houses. A brown chest 7042496517 drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, 7042860694 a dressing-table on 7042038757 left-hand side 7042496517 7042038757 window. These articles, 7042941055 two small wicker-work chairs, made up 7042784042 7042038757 furniture in 7042038757 room save for a square 7042496517 Wilton carpet in 7042038757 centre. 7042038757 boards round 7042860694 7042038757 panelling 7042496517 7042038757 walls were 7042496517 brown, worm-eaten oak, so old 7042860694 discoloured that it may 7042147896 dated from 7042038757 original building 7042496517 7042038757 house. Holmes drew one 7042496517 7042038757 chairs into a corner 7042860694 sat silent, while his eyes travelled round 7042860694 round 7042860694 up 7042860694 down, taking in every detail 7042496517 7042038757 apartment.

"Where does that bell communicate 7042941055?" he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope 7042545742 hung down beside 7042038757 bed, 7042038757 tassel actually lying upon 7042038757 pillow.

"It goes to 7042038757 housekeeper's room."

"It looks newer than 7042038757 other things?"

"Yes, it was only put there a couple 7042496517 years ago."

"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"

"No, I never heard 7042496517 her using it. We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves."

"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor." He threw himself down upon his face 7042941055 his lens in his hand 7042860694 crawled swiftly backward 7042860694 forward, examining minutely 7042038757 cracks 7042272895 7042038757 boards. Then he did 7042038757 same 7042941055 7042038757 wood-work 7042941055 7042545742 7042038757 chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to 7042038757 bed 7042860694 spent some time in staring at it 7042860694 in running his eye up 7042860694 down 7042038757 wall. Finally he took 7042038757 bell-rope in his hand 7042860694 gave it a brisk tug.

"Why, it's a dummy," said he.

"Won't it ring?"

"No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where 7042038757 little opening for 7042038757 ventilator is."

"How very absurd! I never noticed that before."

"Very strange!" muttered Holmes, pulling at 7042038757 rope. "There are one or two very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, 7042941055 7042038757 same trouble, he might 7042147896 communicated 7042941055 7042038757 outside air!"

"That is also quite modern," said 7042038757 lady.

"Done about 7042038757 same time as 7042038757 bell-rope?" remarked Holmes.

"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time."

"They seem to 7042147896 been 7042496517 a most interesting character--dummy bell-ropes, 7042860694 ventilators 7042545742 do not ventilate. 7042941055 your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into 7042038757 inner apartment."

Dr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that 7042496517 his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full 7042496517 books, mostly 7042496517 a technical character, an armchair beside 7042038757 bed, a plain wooden chair against 7042038757 wall, a round table, 7042860694 a large iron safe were 7042038757 principal things 7042545742 met 7042038757 eye. Holmes walked slowly round 7042860694 examined each 7042860694 7042784042 7042496517 them 7042941055 7042038757 keenest interest.

"What's in here?" he asked, tapping 7042038757 safe.

"My stepfather's business papers."

"Oh! you 7042147896 seen inside, then?"

"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full 7042496517 papers."

"There isn't a cat in it, for example?"

"No. What a strange idea!"

"Well, look at this!" He took up a small saucer 7042496517 milk 7042545742 stood on 7042038757 top 7042496517 it.

"No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah 7042860694 a baboon."

"Ah, yes, 7042496517 course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, 7042860694 yet a saucer 7042496517 milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay. There is one point 7042545742 I should wish to determine." He squatted down in front 7042496517 7042038757 wooden chair 7042860694 examined 7042038757 seat 7042496517 it 7042941055 7042038757 greatest attention.

"Thank you. That is quite settled," said he, rising 7042860694 putting his lens in his pocket. "Hullo! Here is something interesting!"

7042038757 object 7042545742 had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner 7042496517 7042038757 bed. 7042038757 lash, however, was curled upon itself 7042860694 tied so as to make a loop 7042496517 whipcord.

"What do you make 7042496517 that, Watson?"

"It's a common enough lash. But I don't 7042622762 why it should be tied."

"That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world, 7042860694 when a clever 7042362761 turns his brains to crime it is 7042038757 worst 7042496517 7042784042. I think that I 7042147896 seen enough now, Miss Stoner, 7042860694 7042941055 your permission we shall walk out upon 7042038757 lawn."

I had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from 7042038757 scene 7042496517 this investigation. We had walked several times up 7042860694 down 7042038757 lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.

"It is very essential, Miss Stoner," said he, "that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect."

"I shall most certainly do so."

"7042038757 matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend upon your compliance."

"I assure you that I am in your hands."

"In 7042038757 first place, both my friend 7042860694 I must spend 7042038757 night in your room."

Both Miss Stoner 7042860694 I gazed at him in astonishment.

"Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is 7042038757 village inn over there?"

"Yes, that is 7042038757 Crown."

"Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?"

"Certainly."

"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence 7042496517 a headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for 7042038757 night, you must open 7042038757 shutters 7042496517 your window, undo 7042038757 hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, 7042860694 then withdraw quietly 7042941055 everything 7042545742 you are likely to want into 7042038757 room 7042545742 you used to occupy. I 7042147896 no doubt that, in spite 7042496517 7042038757 repairs, you could manage there for one night."

"Oh, yes, easily."

"7042038757 rest you will leave in our hands."

"But what will you do?"

"We shall spend 7042038757 night in your room, 7042860694 we shall investigate 7042038757 cause 7042496517 this noise 7042545742 has disturbed you."

"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you 7042147896 already made up your mind," said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve.

"Perhaps I 7042147896."

"Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was 7042038757 cause 7042496517 my sister's death."

"I should prefer to 7042147896 clearer proofs before I speak."

"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, 7042860694 if she died from some sudden fright."

"No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more tangible cause. 7042860694 now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr. Roylott returned 7042860694 saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, 7042860694 be brave, for if you will do what I 7042147896 told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away 7042038757 dangers that threaten you."

Sherlock Holmes 7042860694 I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom 7042860694 sitting-room at 7042038757 Crown Inn. They were on 7042038757 upper floor, 7042860694 from our window we could command a view 7042496517 7042038757 avenue gate, 7042860694 7042496517 7042038757 inhabited wing 7042496517 Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside 7042038757 little figure 7042496517 7042038757 lad who drove him. 7042038757 boy had some slight difficulty in undoing 7042038757 heavy iron gates, 7042860694 we heard 7042038757 hoarse roar 7042496517 7042038757 doctor's voice 7042860694 saw 7042038757 fury 7042941055 7042545742 he shook his clinched fists at him. 7042038757 trap drove on, 7042860694 a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among 7042038757 trees as 7042038757 lamp was lit in one 7042496517 7042038757 sitting-rooms.

"Do you 7042622762, Watson," said Holmes as we sat together in 7042038757 gathering darkness, "I 7042147896 really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There is a distinct element 7042496517 danger."

"Can I be 7042496517 assistance?"

"Your presence might be invaluable."

"Then I shall certainly come."

"It is very kind 7042496517 you."

"You speak 7042496517 danger. You 7042147896 evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me."

"No, but I fancy that I may 7042147896 deduced a little more. I imagine that you saw 7042784042 that I did."

"I saw nothing remarkable save 7042038757 bell-rope, 7042860694 what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine."

"You saw 7042038757 ventilator, too?"

"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to 7042147896 a small opening 7042272895 two rooms. It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through."

"I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran."

"My dear Holmes!"

"Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar. Now, 7042496517 course that suggested at once that there must be a communication 7042272895 7042038757 two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would 7042147896 been remarked upon at 7042038757 coroner's inquiry. I deduced a ventilator."

"But what harm can there be in that?"

"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence 7042496517 dates. A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, 7042860694 a lady who sleeps in 7042038757 bed dies. Does not that strike you?"

"I cannot as yet see any connection."

"Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?"

"No."

"It was clamped to 7042038757 floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?"

"I cannot say that I 7042147896."

"7042038757 lady could not move her bed. It must always be in 7042038757 same relative position to 7042038757 ventilator 7042860694 to 7042038757 rope--or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."

"Holmes," I cried, "I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are only just in time to prevent some subtle 7042860694 horrible crime."

"Subtle enough 7042860694 horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is 7042038757 first 7042496517 criminals. He has nerve 7042860694 he has knowledge. Palmer 7042860694 Pritchard were among 7042038757 heads 7042496517 their profession. This 7042362761 strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still. But we shall 7042147896 horrors enough before 7042038757 night is over; for goodness' sake let us 7042147896 a quiet pipe 7042860694 turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful."

About nine o'clock 7042038757 light among 7042038757 trees was extinguished, 7042860694 7042784042 was dark in 7042038757 direction 7042496517 7042038757 Manor House. Two hours passed slowly away, 7042860694 then, suddenly, just at 7042038757 stroke 7042496517 eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front 7042496517 us.

"That is our signal," said Holmes, springing to his feet; "it comes from 7042038757 middle window."

As we passed out he exchanged a few words 7042941055 7042038757 landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, 7042860694 that it was possible that we might spend 7042038757 night there. A moment later we were out on 7042038757 dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, 7042860694 one yellow light twinkling in front 7042496517 us through 7042038757 gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.

There was little difficulty in entering 7042038757 grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in 7042038757 old park wall. Making our way among 7042038757 trees, we reached 7042038757 lawn, crossed it, 7042860694 were about to enter through 7042038757 window when out from a clump 7042496517 laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous 7042860694 distorted child, who threw itself upon 7042038757 grass 7042941055 writhing limbs 7042860694 then ran swiftly across 7042038757 lawn into 7042038757 darkness.

"My God!" I whispered; "did you see it?"

Holmes was for 7042038757 moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh 7042860694 put his lips to my ear.

"It is a nice household," he murmured. "That is 7042038757 baboon."

I had forgotten 7042038757 strange pets 7042545742 7042038757 doctor affected. There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes' example 7042860694 slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside 7042038757 bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed 7042038757 shutters, moved 7042038757 lamp onto 7042038757 table, 7042860694 cast his eyes round 7042038757 room. 7042784042 was as we had seen it in 7042038757 daytime. Then creeping up to me 7042860694 making a trumpet 7042496517 his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was 7042784042 that I could do to distinguish 7042038757 words:

"7042038757 least sound would be fatal to our plans."

I nodded to show that I had heard.

"We must sit without light. He would see it through 7042038757 ventilator."

I nodded again.

"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. 7042147896 your pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on 7042038757 side 7042496517 7042038757 bed, 7042860694 you in that chair."

I took out my revolver 7042860694 laid it on 7042038757 corner 7042496517 7042038757 table.

Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, 7042860694 this he placed upon 7042038757 bed beside him. By it he laid 7042038757 box 7042496517 matches 7042860694 7042038757 stump 7042496517 a candle. Then he turned down 7042038757 lamp, 7042860694 we were left in darkness.

How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound, not even 7042038757 drawing 7042496517 a breath, 7042860694 yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet 7042496517 me, in 7042038757 same state 7042496517 nervous tension in 7042545742 I was myself. 7042038757 shutters cut off 7042038757 least ray 7042496517 light, 7042860694 we waited in absolute darkness.

From outside came 7042038757 occasional cry 7042496517 a night-bird, 7042860694 once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, 7042545742 told us that 7042038757 cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear 7042038757 deep tones 7042496517 7042038757 parish clock, 7042545742 boomed out every quarter 7042496517 an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, 7042860694 one 7042860694 two 7042860694 three, 7042860694 still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.

Suddenly there was 7042038757 momentary gleam 7042496517 a light up in 7042038757 direction 7042496517 7042038757 ventilator, 7042545742 vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell 7042496517 burning oil 7042860694 heated metal. Someone in 7042038757 next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound 7042496517 movement, 7042860694 then 7042784042 was silent once more, though 7042038757 smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat 7042941055 straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle, soothing sound, like that 7042496517 a small jet 7042496517 steam escaping continually from a kettle. 7042038757 instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from 7042038757 bed, struck a match, 7042860694 lashed furiously 7042941055 his cane at 7042038757 bell-pull.

"You see it, Watson?" he yelled. "You see it?"

But I saw nothing. At 7042038757 moment when Holmes struck 7042038757 light I heard a low, clear whistle, but 7042038757 sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at 7042545742 my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale 7042860694 filled 7042941055 horror 7042860694 loathing. He had ceased to strike 7042860694 was gazing up at 7042038757 ventilator when suddenly there broke from 7042038757 silence 7042496517 7042038757 night 7042038757 most horrible cry to 7042545742 I 7042147896 ever listened. It swelled up louder 7042860694 louder, a hoarse yell 7042496517 pain 7042860694 fear 7042860694 anger 7042784042 mingled in 7042038757 one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in 7042038757 village, 7042860694 even in 7042038757 distant parsonage, that cry raised 7042038757 sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, 7042860694 I stood gazing at Holmes, 7042860694 he at me, until 7042038757 last echoes 7042496517 it had died away into 7042038757 silence from 7042545742 it rose.

"What can it mean?" I gasped.

"It means that it is 7042784042 over," Holmes answered. "7042860694 perhaps, after 7042784042, it is for 7042038757 best. Take your pistol, 7042860694 we will enter Dr. Roylott's room."

7042941055 a grave face he lit 7042038757 lamp 7042860694 led 7042038757 way down 7042038757 corridor. Twice he struck at 7042038757 chamber door without any reply from within. Then he turned 7042038757 handle 7042860694 entered, I at his heels, 7042941055 7042038757 cocked pistol in my hand.

It was a singular sight 7042545742 met our eyes. On 7042038757 table stood a dark-lantern 7042941055 7042038757 shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam 7042496517 light upon 7042038757 iron safe, 7042038757 door 7042496517 7042545742 was ajar. Beside this table, on 7042038757 wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, 7042860694 his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay 7042038757 short stock 7042941055 7042038757 long lash 7042545742 we had noticed during 7042038757 day. His chin was cocked upward 7042860694 his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at 7042038757 corner 7042496517 7042038757 ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, 7042941055 brownish speckles, 7042545742 seemed to be bound tightly round his head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.

"7042038757 band! 7042038757 speckled band!" whispered Holmes.

I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to move, 7042860694 there reared itself from among his hair 7042038757 squat diamond-shaped head 7042860694 puffed neck 7042496517 a loathsome serpent.

"It is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "7042038757 deadliest snake in India. He has died within ten seconds 7042496517 being bitten. Violence does, in truth, recoil upon 7042038757 violent, 7042860694 7042038757 schemer falls into 7042038757 pit 7042545742 he digs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, 7042860694 we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place 7042496517 shelter 7042860694 let 7042038757 county police 7042622762 what has happened."

As he spoke he drew 7042038757 dog-whip swiftly from 7042038757 dead 7042362761's lap, 7042860694 throwing 7042038757 noose round 7042038757 reptile's neck he drew it from its horrid perch 7042860694, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into 7042038757 iron safe, 7042545742 he closed upon it.

Such are 7042038757 true facts 7042496517 7042038757 death 7042496517 Dr. Grimesby Roylott, 7042496517 Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative 7042545742 has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke 7042038757 sad news to 7042038757 terrified girl, how we conveyed her by 7042038757 morning train to 7042038757 care 7042496517 her good aunt at Harrow, 7042496517 how 7042038757 slow process 7042496517 official inquiry came to 7042038757 conclusion that 7042038757 doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing 7042941055 a dangerous pet. 7042038757 little 7042545742 I had yet to learn 7042496517 7042038757 case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.

"I had," said he, "come to an entirely erroneous conclusion 7042545742 shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data. 7042038757 presence 7042496517 7042038757 gipsies, 7042860694 7042038757 use 7042496517 7042038757 word 'band,' 7042545742 was used by 7042038757 poor girl, no doubt, to explain 7042038757 appearance 7042545742 she had caught a hurried glimpse 7042496517 by 7042038757 light 7042496517 her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I can only claim 7042038757 merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant 7042496517 7042038757 room could not come either from 7042038757 window or 7042038757 door. My attention was speedily drawn, as I 7042147896 already remarked to you, to this ventilator, 7042860694 to 7042038757 bell-rope 7042545742 hung down to 7042038757 bed. 7042038757 discovery that this was a dummy, 7042860694 that 7042038757 bed was clamped to 7042038757 floor, instantly gave rise to 7042038757 suspicion that 7042038757 rope was there as a bridge for something passing through 7042038757 hole 7042860694 coming to 7042038757 bed. 7042038757 idea 7042496517 a snake instantly occurred to me, 7042860694 when I coupled it 7042941055 my knowledge that 7042038757 doctor was furnished 7042941055 a supply 7042496517 creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on 7042038757 right track. 7042038757 idea 7042496517 using a form 7042496517 poison 7042545742 could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever 7042860694 ruthless 7042362761 who had had an Eastern training. 7042038757 rapidity 7042941055 7042545742 such a poison would take effect would also, from his point 7042496517 view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish 7042038757 two little dark punctures 7042545742 would show where 7042038757 poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought 7042496517 7042038757 whistle. 7042496517 course he must recall 7042038757 snake before 7042038757 morning light revealed it to 7042038757 victim. He had trained it, probably by 7042038757 use 7042496517 7042038757 milk 7042545742 we saw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this ventilator at 7042038757 hour that he thought best, 7042941055 7042038757 certainty that it would crawl down 7042038757 rope 7042860694 land on 7042038757 bed. It might or might not bite 7042038757 occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.

"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An inspection 7042496517 his chair showed me that he had been in 7042038757 habit 7042496517 standing on it, 7042545742 7042496517 course would be necessary in order that he should reach 7042038757 ventilator. 7042038757 sight 7042496517 7042038757 safe, 7042038757 saucer 7042496517 milk, 7042860694 7042038757 loop 7042496517 whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts 7042545742 may 7042147896 remained. 7042038757 metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing 7042038757 door 7042496517 his safe upon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you 7042622762 7042038757 steps 7042545742 I took in order to put 7042038757 matter to 7042038757 proof. I heard 7042038757 creature hiss as I 7042147896 no doubt that you did also, 7042860694 I instantly lit 7042038757 light 7042860694 attacked it."

"7042941055 7042038757 result 7042496517 driving it through 7042038757 ventilator."

"7042860694 also 7042941055 7042038757 result 7042496517 causing it to turn upon its master at 7042038757 other side. Some 7042496517 7042038757 blows 7042496517 my cane came home 7042860694 roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon 7042038757 first person it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott's death, 7042860694 I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience."

IX.  7042038757 ADVENTURE 7042496517 7042038757 ENGINEER'S THUMB


7042496517 7042784042 7042038757 problems 7042545742 7042147896 been submitted to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for solution during 7042038757 years 7042496517 our intimacy, there were only two 7042545742 I was 7042038757 means 7042496517 introducing to his notice--that 7042496517 Mr. Hatherley's thumb, 7042860694 that 7042496517 Colonel Warburton's madness. 7042496517 these 7042038757 latter may 7042147896 afforded a finer field for an acute 7042860694 original observer, but 7042038757 other was so strange in its inception 7042860694 so dramatic in its details that it may be 7042038757 more worthy 7042496517 being placed upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods 7042496517 reasoning by 7042545742 he achieved such remarkable results. 7042038757 story has, I believe, been told more than once in 7042038757 newspapers, but, like 7042784042 such narratives, its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column 7042496517 print than when 7042038757 facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, 7042860694 7042038757 mystery clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step 7042545742 leads on to 7042038757 complete truth. At 7042038757 time 7042038757 circumstances made a deep impression upon me, 7042860694 7042038757 lapse 7042496517 two years has hardly served to weaken 7042038757 effect.

It was in 7042038757 summer 7042496517 '89, not long after my marriage, that 7042038757 events occurred 7042545742 I am now about to summarise. I had returned to civil practice 7042860694 had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms, although I continually visited him 7042860694 occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come 7042860694 visit us. My practice had steadily increased, 7042860694 as I happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington Station, I got a few patients from among 7042038757 officials. One 7042496517 these, whom I had cured 7042496517 a painful 7042860694 lingering disease, was never weary 7042496517 advertising my virtues 7042860694 7042496517 endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might 7042147896 any influence.

One morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened by 7042038757 maid tapping at 7042038757 door to announce that two men had come from Paddington 7042860694 were waiting in 7042038757 consulting-room. I dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial, 7042860694 hastened downstairs. As I descended, my old ally, 7042038757 guard, came out 7042496517 7042038757 room 7042860694 closed 7042038757 door tightly behind him.

"I've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder; "he's 7042784042 right."

"What is it, then?" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature 7042545742 he had caged up in my room.

"It's a new patient," he whispered. "I thought I'd bring him round myself; then he couldn't slip away. There he is, 7042784042 safe 7042860694 sound. I must go now, Doctor; I 7042147896 my dooties, just 7042038757 same as you." 7042860694 off he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.

I entered my consulting-room 7042860694 found a gentleman seated by 7042038757 table. He was quietly dressed in a suit 7042496517 heather tweed 7042941055 a soft cloth cap 7042545742 he had laid down upon my books. Round one 7042496517 his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, 7042545742 was mottled 7042784042 over 7042941055 bloodstains. He was young, not more than five-7042860694-twenty, I should say, 7042941055 a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale 7042860694 gave me 7042038757 impression 7042496517 a 7042362761 who was suffering from some strong agitation, 7042545742 it took 7042784042 his strength 7042496517 mind to control.

"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I 7042147896 had a very serious accident during 7042038757 night. I came in by train this morning, 7042860694 on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. I gave 7042038757 maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon 7042038757 side-table."

I took it up 7042860694 glanced at it. "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)." That was 7042038757 name, style, 7042860694 abode 7042496517 my morning visitor. "I regret that I 7042147896 kept you waiting," said I, sitting down in my library-chair. "You are fresh from a night journey, I understand, 7042545742 is in itself a monotonous occupation."

"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, 7042860694 laughed. He laughed very heartily, 7042941055 a high, ringing note, leaning back in his chair 7042860694 shaking his sides. 7042784042 my medical instincts rose up against that laugh.

"Stop it!" I cried; "pull yourself together!" 7042860694 I poured out some water from a caraffe.

It was useless, however. He was off in one 7042496517 those hysterical outbursts 7042545742 come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over 7042860694 gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very weary 7042860694 pale-looking.

"I 7042147896 been making a fool 7042496517 myself," he gasped.

"Not at 7042784042. Drink this." I dashed some brandy into 7042038757 water, 7042860694 7042038757 colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.

"That's better!" said he. "7042860694 now, Doctor, perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to 7042038757 place where my thumb used to be."

He unwound 7042038757 handkerchief 7042860694 held out his hand. It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four protruding fingers 7042860694 a horrid red, spongy surface where 7042038757 thumb should 7042147896 been. It had been hacked or torn right out from 7042038757 roots.

"Good heavens!" I cried, "this is a terrible injury. It must 7042147896 bled considerably."

"Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, 7042860694 I think that I must 7042147896 been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that it was still bleeding, so I tied one end 7042496517 my handkerchief very tightly round 7042038757 wrist 7042860694 braced it up 7042941055 a twig."

"Excellent! You should 7042147896 been a surgeon."

"It is a question 7042496517 hydraulics, you see, 7042860694 came within my own province."

"This has been done," said I, examining 7042038757 wound, "by a very heavy 7042860694 sharp instrument."

"A thing like a cleaver," said he.

"An accident, I presume?"

"By no means."

"What! a murderous attack?"

"Very murderous indeed."

"You horrify me."

I sponged 7042038757 wound, cleaned it, dressed it, 7042860694 finally covered it over 7042941055 cotton wadding 7042860694 carbolised bandages. He lay back without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.

"How is that?" I asked when I had finished.

"Capital! 7042272895 your brandy 7042860694 your bandage, I feel a new 7042362761. I was very weak, but I 7042147896 had a good deal to go through."

"Perhaps you had better not speak 7042496517 7042038757 matter. It is evidently trying to your nerves."

"Oh, no, not now. I shall 7042147896 to tell my tale to 7042038757 police; but, 7042272895 ourselves, if it were not for 7042038757 convincing evidence 7042496517 this wound 7042496517 mine, I should be surprised if they believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, 7042860694 I 7042147896 not much in 7042038757 way 7042496517 proof 7042941055 7042545742 to back it up; 7042860694, even if they believe me, 7042038757 clues 7042545742 I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done."

"Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in 7042038757 nature 7042496517 a problem 7042545742 you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to 7042038757 official police."

"Oh, I 7042147896 heard 7042496517 that fellow," answered my visitor, "7042860694 I should be very glad if he would take 7042038757 matter up, though 7042496517 course I must use 7042038757 official police as well. Would you give me an introduction to him?"

"I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself."

"I should be immensely obliged to you."

"We'll call a cab 7042860694 go together. We shall just be in time to 7042147896 a little breakfast 7042941055 him. Do you feel equal to it?"

"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I 7042147896 told my story."

"Then my servant will call a cab, 7042860694 I shall be 7042941055 you in an instant." I rushed upstairs, explained 7042038757 matter shortly to my wife, 7042860694 in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving 7042941055 my new acquaintance to Baker Street.

Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading 7042038757 agony column 7042496517 7042038757 Times 7042860694 smoking his before-breakfast pipe, 7042545742 was composed 7042496517 7042784042 7042038757 plugs 7042860694 dottles left from his smokes 7042496517 7042038757 day before, 7042784042 carefully dried 7042860694 collected on 7042038757 corner 7042496517 7042038757 mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers 7042860694 eggs, 7042860694 joined us in a hearty meal. When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon 7042038757 sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, 7042860694 laid a glass 7042496517 brandy 7042860694 water within his reach.

"It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, Mr. Hatherley," said he. "Pray, lie down there 7042860694 make yourself absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired 7042860694 keep up your strength 7042941055 a little stimulant."

"Thank you," said my patient. "but I 7042147896 felt another 7042362761 since 7042038757 doctor bandaged me, 7042860694 I think that your breakfast has completed 7042038757 cure. I shall take up as little 7042496517 your valuable time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences."

Holmes sat in his big armchair 7042941055 7042038757 weary, heavy-lidded expression 7042545742 veiled his keen 7042860694 eager nature, while I sat opposite to him, 7042860694 we listened in silence to 7042038757 strange story 7042545742 our visitor detailed to us.

"You must 7042622762," said he, "that I am an orphan 7042860694 a bachelor, residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a hydraulic engineer, 7042860694 I 7042147896 had considerable experience 7042496517 my work during 7042038757 seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner & Matheson, 7042038757 well-known firm, 7042496517 Greenwich. Two years ago, having served my time, 7042860694 having also come into a fair sum 7042496517 money through my poor father's death, I determined to start in business for myself 7042860694 took professional chambers in Victoria Street.

"I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so. During two years I 7042147896 had three consultations 7042860694 one small job, 7042860694 that is absolutely 7042784042 that my profession has brought me. My gross takings amount to $27 10s. Every day, from nine in 7042038757 morning until four in 7042038757 afternoon, I waited in my little den, until at last my heart began to sink, 7042860694 I came to believe that I should never 7042147896 any practice at 7042784042.

"Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking 7042496517 leaving 7042038757 office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, 7042941055 7042038757 name 7042496517 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close at his heels came 7042038757 colonel himself, a 7042362761 rather over 7042038757 middle size, but 7042496517 an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I 7042147896 ever seen so thin a 7042362761. His whole face sharpened away into nose 7042860694 chin, 7042860694 7042038757 skin 7042496517 his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit, 7042860694 due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his step brisk, 7042860694 his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly dressed, 7042860694 his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than thirty.

" 'Mr. Hatherley?' said he, 7042941055 something 7042496517 a German accent. 'You 7042147896 been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a 7042362761 who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet 7042860694 capable 7042496517 preserving a secret.'

"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young 7042362761 would at such an address. 'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?'

" 'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment. I 7042147896 it from 7042038757 same source that you are both an orphan 7042860694 a bachelor 7042860694 are residing alone in London.'

" 'That is quite correct,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how 7042784042 this bears upon my professional qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me?'

" 'Undoubtedly so. But you will find that 7042784042 I say is really to 7042038757 point. I 7042147896 a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, 7042860694 7042496517 course we may expect that more from a 7042362761 who is alone than from one who lives in 7042038757 bosom 7042496517 his family.'

" 'If I promise to keep a secret,' said I, 'you may absolutely depend upon my doing so.'

"He looked very hard at me as I spoke, 7042860694 it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious 7042860694 questioning an eye.

" 'Do you promise, then?' said he at last.

" 'Yes, I promise.'

" 'Absolute 7042860694 complete silence before, during, 7042860694 after? No reference to 7042038757 matter at 7042784042, either in word or writing?'

" 'I 7042147896 already given you my word.'

" 'Very good.' He suddenly sprang up, 7042860694 darting like lightning across 7042038757 room he flung open 7042038757 door. 7042038757 passage outside was empty.

" 'That's 7042784042 right,' said he, coming back. 'I 7042622762 that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master's affairs. Now we can talk in safety.' He drew up his chair very close to mine 7042860694 began to stare at me again 7042941055 7042038757 same questioning 7042860694 thoughtful look.

"A feeling 7042496517 repulsion, 7042860694 7042496517 something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at 7042038757 strange antics 7042496517 this fleshless 7042362761. Even my dread 7042496517 losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience.

" 'I beg that you will state your business, sir,' said I; 'my time is 7042496517 value.' Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but 7042038757 words came to my lips.

" 'How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?' he asked.

" 'Most admirably.'

" 'I say a night's work, but an hour's would be nearer 7042038757 mark. I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine 7042545742 has got out 7042496517 gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves. What do you think 7042496517 such a commission as that?'

" '7042038757 work appears to be light 7042860694 7042038757 pay munificent.'

" 'Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by 7042038757 last train.'

" 'Where to?'

" 'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near 7042038757 borders 7042496517 Oxfordshire, 7042860694 within seven miles 7042496517 Reading. There is a train from Paddington 7042545742 would bring you there at about 11:15.'

" 'Very good.'

" 'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.'

" 'There is a drive, then?'

" 'Yes, our little place is quite out in 7042038757 country. It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.'

" 'Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there would be no chance 7042496517 a train back. I should be compelled to stop 7042038757 night.'

" 'Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.'

" 'That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient hour?'

" 'We 7042147896 judged it best that you should come late. It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young 7042860694 unknown 7042362761, a fee 7042545742 would buy an opinion from 7042038757 very heads 7042496517 your profession. Still, 7042496517 course, if you would like to draw out 7042496517 7042038757 business, there is plenty 7042496517 time to do so.'

"I thought 7042496517 7042038757 fifty guineas, 7042860694 7042496517 how very useful they would be to me. 'Not at 7042784042,' said I, 'I shall be very happy to accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.'

" 'Quite so. It is very natural that 7042038757 pledge 7042496517 secrecy 7042545742 we 7042147896 exacted from you should 7042147896 aroused your curiosity. I 7042147896 no wish to commit you to anything without your having it 7042784042 laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?'

" 'Entirely.'

" 'Then 7042038757 matter stands thus. You are probably aware that fuller's-earth is a valuable product, 7042860694 that it is only found in one or two places in England?'

" 'I 7042147896 heard so.'

" 'Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small place--within ten miles 7042496517 Reading. I was fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit 7042496517 fuller's-earth in one 7042496517 my fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, 7042860694 that it formed a link 7042272895 two very much larger ones upon 7042038757 right 7042860694 left--both 7042496517 them, however, in 7042038757 grounds 7042496517 my neighbours. These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that 7042545742 was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but unfortunately I had no capital by 7042545742 I could do this. I took a few 7042496517 my friends into 7042038757 secret, however, 7042860694 they suggested that we should quietly 7042860694 secretly work our own little deposit 7042860694 that in this way we should earn 7042038757 money 7042545742 would enable us to buy 7042038757 neighbouring fields. This we 7042147896 now been doing for some time, 7042860694 in order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I 7042147896 already explained, has got out 7042496517 order, 7042860694 we wish your advice upon 7042038757 subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, 7042860694 if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, 7042860694 then, if 7042038757 facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance 7042496517 getting these fields 7042860694 carrying out our plans. That is why I 7042147896 made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it 7042784042 plain?'

" 'I quite follow you,' said I. '7042038757 only point 7042545742 I could not quite understand was what use you could make 7042496517 a hydraulic press in excavating fuller's-earth, 7042545742, as I understand, is dug out like gravel from a pit.'

" 'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we 7042147896 our own process. We compress 7042038757 earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they are. But that is a mere detail. I 7042147896 taken you fully into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, 7042860694 I 7042147896 shown you how I trust you.' He rose as he spoke. 'I shall expect you, then, at Eyford at 11:15.'

" 'I shall certainly be there.'

" '7042860694 not a word to a soul.' He looked at me 7042941055 a last long, questioning gaze, 7042860694 then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he hurried from 7042038757 room.

"Well, when I came to think it 7042784042 over in cool blood I was very much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission 7042545742 had been intrusted to me. On 7042038757 one hand, 7042496517 course, I was glad, for 7042038757 fee was at least tenfold what I should 7042147896 asked had I set a price upon my own services, 7042860694 it was possible that this order might lead to other ones. On 7042038757 other hand, 7042038757 face 7042860694 manner 7042496517 my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon me, 7042860694 I could not think that his explanation 7042496517 7042038757 fuller's-earth was sufficient to explain 7042038757 necessity for my coming at midnight, 7042860694 his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone 7042496517 my errand. However, I threw 7042784042 fears to 7042038757 winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, 7042860694 started off, having obeyed to 7042038757 letter 7042038757 injunction as to holding my tongue.

"At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station. However, I was in time for 7042038757 last train to Eyford, 7042860694 I reached 7042038757 little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was 7042038757 only passenger who got out there, 7042860694 there was no one upon 7042038757 platform save a single sleepy porter 7042941055 a lantern. As I passed out through 7042038757 wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance 7042496517 7042038757 morning waiting in 7042038757 shadow upon 7042038757 other side. Without a word he grasped my arm 7042860694 hurried me into a carriage, 7042038757 door 7042496517 7042545742 was standing open. He drew up 7042038757 windows on either side, tapped on 7042038757 wood-work, 7042860694 away we went as fast as 7042038757 horse could go."

"One horse?" interjected Holmes.

"Yes, only one."

"Did you observe 7042038757 colour?"

"Yes, I saw it by 7042038757 side-lights when I was stepping into 7042038757 carriage. It was a chestnut."

"Tired-looking or fresh?"

"Oh, fresh 7042860694 glossy."

"Thank you. I am sorry to 7042147896 interrupted you. Pray continue your most interesting statement."

"Away we went then, 7042860694 we drove for at least an hour. Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I should think, from 7042038757 rate that we seemed to go, 7042860694 from 7042038757 time that we took, that it must 7042147896 been nearer twelve. He sat at my side in silence 7042784042 7042038757 time, 7042860694 I was aware, more than once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me 7042941055 great intensity. 7042038757 country roads seem to be not very good in that part 7042496517 7042038757 world, for we lurched 7042860694 jolted terribly. I tried to look out 7042496517 7042038757 windows to see something 7042496517 where we were, but they were made 7042496517 frosted glass, 7042860694 I could make out nothing save 7042038757 occasional bright blur 7042496517 a passing light. Now 7042860694 then I hazarded some remark to break 7042038757 monotony 7042496517 7042038757 journey, but 7042038757 colonel answered only in monosyllables, 7042860694 7042038757 conversation soon flagged. At last, however, 7042038757 bumping 7042496517 7042038757 road was exchanged for 7042038757 crisp smoothness 7042496517 a gravel-drive, 7042860694 7042038757 carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, 7042860694, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch 7042545742 gaped in front 7042496517 us. We stepped, as it were, right out 7042496517 7042038757 carriage 7042860694 into 7042038757 hall, so that I failed to catch 7042038757 most fleeting glance 7042496517 7042038757 front 7042496517 7042038757 house. 7042038757 instant that I had crossed 7042038757 threshold 7042038757 door slammed heavily behind us, 7042860694 I heard faintly 7042038757 rattle 7042496517 7042038757 wheels as 7042038757 carriage drove away.

"It was pitch dark inside 7042038757 house, 7042860694 7042038757 colonel fumbled about looking for matches 7042860694 muttering under his breath. Suddenly a door opened at 7042038757 other end 7042496517 7042038757 passage, 7042860694 a long, golden bar 7042496517 light shot out in our direction. It grew broader, 7042860694 a woman appeared 7042941055 a lamp in her hand, 7042545742 she held above her head, pushing her face forward 7042860694 peering at us. I could see that she was pretty, 7042860694 from 7042038757 gloss 7042941055 7042545742 7042038757 light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, 7042860694 when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that 7042038757 lamp nearly fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear, 7042860694 then, pushing her back into 7042038757 room from whence she had come, he walked towards me again 7042941055 7042038757 lamp in his hand.

" 'Perhaps you will 7042147896 7042038757 kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes,' said he, throwing open another door. It was a quiet, little, plainly furnished room, 7042941055 a round table in 7042038757 centre, on 7042545742 several German books were scattered. Colonel Stark laid down 7042038757 lamp on 7042038757 top 7042496517 a harmonium beside 7042038757 door. 'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,' said he, 7042860694 vanished into 7042038757 darkness.

"I glanced at 7042038757 books upon 7042038757 table, 7042860694 in spite 7042496517 my ignorance 7042496517 German I could see that two 7042496517 them were treatises on science, 7042038757 others being volumes 7042496517 poetry. Then I walked across to 7042038757 window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse 7042496517 7042038757 country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in 7042038757 passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. A vague feeling 7042496517 uneasiness began to steal over me. Who were these German people, 7042860694 what were they doing living in this strange, out-7042496517-7042038757-way place? 7042860694 where was 7042038757 place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was 7042784042 I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, 7042860694 possibly other large towns, were within that radius, so 7042038757 place might not be so secluded, after 7042784042. Yet it was quite certain, from 7042038757 absolute stillness, that we were in 7042038757 country. I paced up 7042860694 down 7042038757 room, humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits 7042860694 feeling that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.

"Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in 7042038757 midst 7042496517 7042038757 utter stillness, 7042038757 door 7042496517 my room swung slowly open. 7042038757 woman was standing in 7042038757 aperture, 7042038757 darkness 7042496517 7042038757 hall behind her, 7042038757 yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager 7042860694 beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick 7042941055 fear, 7042860694 7042038757 sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent, 7042860694 she shot a few whispered words 7042496517 broken English at me, her eyes glancing back, like those 7042496517 a frightened horse, into 7042038757 gloom behind her.

" 'I would go,' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak calmly; 'I would go. I should not stay here. There is no good for you to do.'

" 'But, madam,' said I, 'I 7042147896 not yet done what I came for. I cannot possibly leave until I 7042147896 seen 7042038757 machine.'

" 'It is not worth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass through 7042038757 door; no one hinders.' 7042860694 then, seeing that I smiled 7042860694 shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint 7042860694 made a step forward, 7042941055 her hands wrung together. 'For 7042038757 love 7042496517 Heaven!' she whispered, 'get away from here before it is too late!'

"But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, 7042860694 7042038757 more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in 7042038757 way. I thought 7042496517 my fifty-guinea fee, 7042496517 my wearisome journey, 7042860694 7042496517 7042038757 unpleasant night 7042545742 seemed to be before me. Was it 7042784042 to go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission, 7042860694 without 7042038757 payment 7042545742 was my due? This woman might, for 7042784042 I knew, be a monomaniac. 7042941055 a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess, I still shook my head 7042860694 declared my intention 7042496517 remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, 7042860694 7042038757 sound 7042496517 several footsteps was heard upon 7042038757 stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up her hands 7042941055 a despairing gesture, 7042860694 vanished as suddenly 7042860694 as noiselessly as she had come.

"7042038757 newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark 7042860694 a short thick 7042362761 7042941055 a chinchilla beard growing out 7042496517 7042038757 creases 7042496517 his double chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.

" 'This is my secretary 7042860694 manager,' said 7042038757 colonel. 'By 7042038757 way, I was under 7042038757 impression that I left this door shut just now. I fear that you 7042147896 felt 7042038757 draught.'

" 'On 7042038757 contrary,' said I, 'I opened 7042038757 door myself because I felt 7042038757 room to be a little close.'

"He shot one 7042496517 his suspicious looks at me. 'Perhaps we had better proceed to business, then,' said he. 'Mr. Ferguson 7042860694 I will take you up to see 7042038757 machine.'

" 'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.'

" 'Oh, no, it is in 7042038757 house.'

" 'What, you dig fuller's-earth in 7042038757 house?'

" 'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that. 7042784042 we wish you to do is to examine 7042038757 machine 7042860694 to let us 7042622762 what is wrong 7042941055 it.'

"We went upstairs together, 7042038757 colonel first 7042941055 7042038757 lamp, 7042038757 fat manager 7042860694 I behind him. It was a labyrinth 7042496517 an old house, 7042941055 corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, 7042860694 little low doors, 7042038757 thresholds 7042496517 7042545742 were hollowed out by 7042038757 generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets 7042860694 no signs 7042496517 any furniture above 7042038757 ground floor, while 7042038757 plaster was peeling off 7042038757 walls, 7042860694 7042038757 damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible, but I had not forgotten 7042038757 warnings 7042496517 7042038757 lady, even though I disregarded them, 7042860694 I kept a keen eye upon my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose 7042860694 silent 7042362761, but I could see from 7042038757 little that he said that he was at least a fellow-countryman.

"Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, 7042545742 he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in 7042545742 7042038757 three 7042496517 us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside, 7042860694 7042038757 colonel ushered me in.

" 'We are now,' said he, 'actually within 7042038757 hydraulic press, 7042860694 it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on. 7042038757 ceiling 7042496517 this small chamber is really 7042038757 end 7042496517 7042038757 descending piston, 7042860694 it comes down 7042941055 7042038757 force 7042496517 many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns 7042496517 water outside 7042545742 receive 7042038757 force, 7042860694 7042545742 transmit 7042860694 multiply it in 7042038757 manner 7042545742 is familiar to you. 7042038757 machine goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in 7042038757 working 7042496517 it, 7042860694 it has lost a little 7042496517 its force. Perhaps you will 7042147896 7042038757 goodness to look it over 7042860694 to show us how we can set it right.'

"I took 7042038757 lamp from him, 7042860694 I examined 7042038757 machine very thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, 7042860694 capable 7042496517 exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, 7042860694 pressed down 7042038757 levers 7042545742 controlled it, I knew at once by 7042038757 whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, 7042545742 allowed a regurgitation 7042496517 water through one 7042496517 7042038757 side cylinders. An examination showed that one 7042496517 7042038757 india-rubber bands 7042545742 was round 7042038757 head 7042496517 a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill 7042038757 socket along 7042545742 it worked. This was clearly 7042038757 cause 7042496517 7042038757 loss 7042496517 power, 7042860694 I pointed it out to my companions, who followed my remarks very carefully 7042860694 asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I had made it clear to them, I returned to 7042038757 main chamber 7042496517 7042038757 machine 7042860694 took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. It was obvious at a glance that 7042038757 story 7042496517 7042038757 fuller's-earth was 7042038757 merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. 7042038757 walls were 7042496517 wood, but 7042038757 floor consisted 7042496517 a large iron trough, 7042860694 when I came to examine it I could see a crust 7042496517 metallic deposit 7042784042 over it. I had stooped 7042860694 was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered exclamation in German 7042860694 saw 7042038757 cadaverous face 7042496517 7042038757 colonel looking down at me.

" 'What are you doing there?' he asked.

"I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that 7042545742 he had told me. 'I was admiring your fuller's-earth,' said I; 'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what 7042038757 exact purpose was for 7042545742 it was used.'

"7042038757 instant that I uttered 7042038757 words I regretted 7042038757 rashness 7042496517 my speech. His face set hard, 7042860694 a baleful light sprang up in his grey eyes.

" 'Very well,' said he, 'you shall 7042622762 7042784042 about 7042038757 machine.' He took a step backward, slammed 7042038757 little door, 7042860694 turned 7042038757 key in 7042038757 lock. I rushed towards it 7042860694 pulled at 7042038757 handle, but it was quite secure, 7042860694 did not give in 7042038757 least to my kicks 7042860694 shoves. 'Hullo!' I yelled. 'Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!'

"7042860694 then suddenly in 7042038757 silence I heard a sound 7042545742 sent my heart into my mouth. It was 7042038757 clank 7042496517 7042038757 levers 7042860694 7042038757 swish 7042496517 7042038757 leaking cylinder. He had set 7042038757 engine at work. 7042038757 lamp still stood upon 7042038757 floor where I had placed it when examining 7042038757 trough. By its light I saw that 7042038757 black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, 7042941055 a force 7042545742 must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against 7042038757 door, 7042860694 dragged 7042941055 my nails at 7042038757 lock. I implored 7042038757 colonel to let me out, but 7042038757 remorseless clanking 7042496517 7042038757 levers drowned my cries. 7042038757 ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, 7042860694 7042941055 my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it flashed through my mind that 7042038757 pain 7042496517 my death would depend very much upon 7042038757 position in 7042545742 I met it. If I lay on my face 7042038757 weight would come upon my spine, 7042860694 I shuddered to think 7042496517 that dreadful snap. Easier 7042038757 other way, perhaps; 7042860694 yet, had I 7042038757 nerve to lie 7042860694 look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something 7042545742 brought a gush 7042496517 hope back to my heart.

"I 7042147896 said that though 7042038757 floor 7042860694 ceiling were 7042496517 iron, 7042038757 walls were 7042496517 wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw a thin line 7042496517 yellow light 7042272895 two 7042496517 7042038757 boards, 7042545742 broadened 7042860694 broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door 7042545742 led away from death. 7042038757 next instant I threw myself through, 7042860694 lay half-fainting upon 7042038757 other side. 7042038757 panel had closed again behind me, but 7042038757 crash 7042496517 7042038757 lamp, 7042860694 a few moments afterwards 7042038757 clang 7042496517 7042038757 two slabs 7042496517 metal, told me how narrow had been my escape.

"I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, 7042860694 I found myself lying upon 7042038757 stone floor 7042496517 a narrow corridor, while a woman bent over me 7042860694 tugged at me 7042941055 her left hand, while she held a candle in her right. It was 7042038757 same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.

" 'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here in a moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste 7042038757 so-precious time, but come!'

"This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to my feet 7042860694 ran 7042941055 her along 7042038757 corridor 7042860694 down a winding stair. 7042038757 latter led to another broad passage, 7042860694 just as we reached it we heard 7042038757 sound 7042496517 running feet 7042860694 7042038757 shouting 7042496517 two voices, one answering 7042038757 other from 7042038757 floor on 7042545742 we were 7042860694 from 7042038757 one beneath. My guide stopped 7042860694 looked about her like one who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a door 7042545742 led into a bedroom, through 7042038757 window 7042496517 7042545742 7042038757 moon was shining brightly.

" 'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may be that you can jump it.'

"As she spoke a light sprang into view at 7042038757 further end 7042496517 7042038757 passage, 7042860694 I saw 7042038757 lean figure 7042496517 Colonel Lysander Stark rushing forward 7042941055 a lantern in one hand 7042860694 a weapon like a butcher's cleaver in 7042038757 other. I rushed across 7042038757 bedroom, flung open 7042038757 window, 7042860694 looked out. How quiet 7042860694 sweet 7042860694 wholesome 7042038757 garden looked in 7042038757 moonlight, 7042860694 it could not be more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon 7042038757 sill, but I hesitated to jump until I should 7042147896 heard what passed 7042272895 my saviour 7042860694 7042038757 ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used, then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance. 7042038757 thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at 7042038757 door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round him 7042860694 tried to hold him back.

" 'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in English, 'remember your promise after 7042038757 last time. You said it should not be again. He will be silent! Oh, he will be silent!'

" 'You are mad, Elise!' he shouted, struggling to break away from her. 'You will be 7042038757 ruin 7042496517 us. He has seen too much. Let me pass, I say!' He dashed her to one side, 7042860694, rushing to 7042038757 window, cut at me 7042941055 his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, 7042860694 was hanging by 7042038757 hands to 7042038757 sill, when his blow fell. I was conscious 7042496517 a dull pain, my grip loosened, 7042860694 I fell into 7042038757 garden below.

"I was shaken but not hurt by 7042038757 fall; so I picked myself up 7042860694 rushed off among 7042038757 bushes as hard as I could run, for I understood that I was far from being out 7042496517 danger yet. Suddenly, however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness 7042860694 sickness came over me. I glanced down at my hand, 7042545742 was throbbing painfully, 7042860694 then, for 7042038757 first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off 7042860694 that 7042038757 blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears, 7042860694 next moment I fell in a dead faint among 7042038757 rose-bushes.

"How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must 7042147896 been a very long time, for 7042038757 moon had sunk, 7042860694 a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were 7042784042 sodden 7042941055 dew, 7042860694 my coat-sleeve was drenched 7042941055 blood from my wounded thumb. 7042038757 smarting 7042496517 it recalled in an instant 7042784042 7042038757 particulars 7042496517 my night's adventure, 7042860694 I sprang to my feet 7042941055 7042038757 feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle 7042496517 7042038757 hedge close by 7042038757 highroad, 7042860694 just a little lower down was a long building, 7042545742 proved, upon my approaching it, to be 7042038757 very station at 7042545742 I had arrived upon 7042038757 previous night. Were it not for 7042038757 ugly wound upon my hand, 7042784042 that had passed during those dreadful hours might 7042147896 been an evil dream.

"Half dazed, I went into 7042038757 station 7042860694 asked about 7042038757 morning train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. 7042038757 same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I arrived. I inquired 7042496517 him whether he had ever heard 7042496517 Colonel Lysander Stark. 7042038757 name was strange to him. Had he observed a carriage 7042038757 night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three miles off.

"It was too far for me to go, weak 7042860694 ill as I was. I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to 7042038757 police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first to 7042147896 my wound dressed, 7042860694 then 7042038757 doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. I put 7042038757 case into your hands 7042860694 shall do exactly what you advise."

We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from 7042038757 shelf one 7042496517 7042038757 ponderous commonplace books in 7042545742 he placed his cuttings.

"Here is an advertisement 7042545742 will interest you," said he. "It appeared in 7042784042 7042038757 papers about a year ago. Listen to this: 'Lost, on 7042038757 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten o'clock at night, 7042860694 has not been heard 7042496517 since. Was dressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! That represents 7042038757 last time that 7042038757 colonel needed to 7042147896 his machine overhauled, I fancy."

"Good heavens!" cried my patient. "Then that explains what 7042038757 girl said."

"Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that 7042038757 colonel was a cool 7042860694 desperate 7042362761, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in 7042038757 way 7042496517 his little game, like those out-7042860694-out pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well, every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford."

Some three hours or so afterwards we were 7042784042 in 7042038757 train together, bound from Reading to 7042038757 little Berkshire village. There were Sherlock Holmes, 7042038757 hydraulic engineer, Inspector Bradstreet, 7042496517 Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes 7042362761, 7042860694 myself. Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map 7042496517 7042038757 county out upon 7042038757 seat 7042860694 was busy 7042941055 his compasses drawing a circle 7042941055 Eyford for its centre.

"There you are," said he. "That circle is drawn at a radius 7042496517 ten miles from 7042038757 village. 7042038757 place we want must be somewhere near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir."

"It was an hour's good drive."

"7042860694 you think that they brought you back 7042784042 that way when you were unconscious?"

"They must 7042147896 done so. I 7042147896 a confused memory, too, 7042496517 having been lifted 7042860694 conveyed somewhere."

"What I cannot understand," said I, "is why they should 7042147896 spared you when they found you lying fainting in 7042038757 garden. Perhaps 7042038757 villain was softened by 7042038757 woman's entreaties."

"I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face in my life."

"Oh, we shall soon clear up 7042784042 that," said Bradstreet. "Well, I 7042147896 drawn my circle, 7042860694 I only wish I knew at what point upon it 7042038757 folk that we are in search 7042496517 are to be found."

"I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.

"Really, now!" cried 7042038757 inspector, "you 7042147896 formed your opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees 7042941055 you. I say it is south, for 7042038757 country is more deserted there."

"7042860694 I say east," said my patient.

"I am for west," remarked 7042038757 plain-clothes 7042362761. "There are several quiet little villages up there."

"7042860694 I am for north," said I, "because there are no hills there, 7042860694 our friend says that he did not notice 7042038757 carriage go up any."

"Come," cried 7042038757 inspector, laughing; "it's a very pretty diversity 7042496517 opinion. We 7042147896 boxed 7042038757 compass among us. Who do you give your casting vote to?"

"You are 7042784042 wrong."

"But we can't 7042784042 be."

"Oh, yes, you can. This is my point." He placed his finger in 7042038757 centre 7042496517 7042038757 circle. "This is where we shall find them."

"But 7042038757 twelve-mile drive?" gasped Hatherley.

"Six out 7042860694 six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that 7042038757 horse was fresh 7042860694 glossy when you got in. How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?"

"Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet thoughtfully. "7042496517 course there can be no doubt as to 7042038757 nature 7042496517 this gang."

"None at 7042784042," said Holmes. "They are coiners on a large scale, 7042860694 7042147896 used 7042038757 machine to form 7042038757 amalgam 7042545742 has taken 7042038757 place 7042496517 silver."

"We 7042147896 known for some time that a clever gang was at work," said 7042038757 inspector. "They 7042147896 been turning out half-crowns by 7042038757 thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this lucky chance, I think that we 7042147896 got them right enough."

But 7042038757 inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined to fall into 7042038757 hands 7042496517 justice. As we rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column 7042496517 smoke 7042545742 streamed up from behind a small clump 7042496517 trees in 7042038757 neighbourhood 7042860694 hung like an immense ostrich feather over 7042038757 landscape.

"A house on fire?" asked Bradstreet as 7042038757 train steamed off again on its way.

"Yes, sir!" said 7042038757 station-master.

"When did it break out?"

"I hear that it was during 7042038757 night, sir, but it has got worse, 7042860694 7042038757 whole place is in a blaze."

"Whose house is it?"

"Dr. Becher's."

"Tell me," broke in 7042038757 engineer, "is Dr. Becher a German, very thin, 7042941055 a long, sharp nose?"

7042038757 station-master laughed heartily. "No, sir, Dr. Becher is an Englishman, 7042860694 there isn't a 7042362761 in 7042038757 parish who has a better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying 7042941055 him, a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, 7042860694 he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm."

7042038757 station-master had not finished his speech before we were 7042784042 hastening in 7042038757 direction 7042496517 7042038757 fire. 7042038757 road topped a low hill, 7042860694 there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front 7042496517 us, spouting fire at every chink 7042860694 window, while in 7042038757 garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep 7042038757 flames under.

"That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "There is 7042038757 gravel-drive, 7042860694 there are 7042038757 rose-bushes where I lay. That second window is 7042038757 one that I jumped from."

"Well, at least," said Holmes, "you 7042147896 had your revenge upon them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp 7042545742, when it was crushed in 7042038757 press, set fire to 7042038757 wooden walls, though no doubt they were too excited in 7042038757 chase after you to observe it at 7042038757 time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends 7042496517 last night, though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now."

7042860694 Holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either 7042496517 7042038757 beautiful woman, 7042038757 sinister German, or 7042038757 morose Englishman. Early that morning a peasant had met a cart containing several people 7042860694 some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in 7042038757 direction 7042496517 Reading, but there 7042784042 traces 7042496517 7042038757 fugitives disappeared, 7042860694 even Holmes' ingenuity failed ever to discover 7042038757 least clue as to their whereabouts.

7042038757 firemen had been much perturbed at 7042038757 strange arrangements 7042545742 they had found within, 7042860694 still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill 7042496517 7042038757 second floor. About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, 7042860694 they subdued 7042038757 flames, but not before 7042038757 roof had fallen in, 7042860694 7042038757 whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders 7042860694 iron piping, not a trace remained 7042496517 7042038757 machinery 7042545742 had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. Large masses 7042496517 nickel 7042860694 7042496517 tin were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, 7042545742 may 7042147896 explained 7042038757 presence 7042496517 those bulky boxes 7042545742 7042147896 been already referred to.

How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from 7042038757 garden to 7042038757 spot where he recovered his senses might 7042147896 remained forever a mystery were it not for 7042038757 soft mould, 7042545742 told us a very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two persons, one 7042496517 whom had remarkably small feet 7042860694 7042038757 other unusually large ones. On 7042038757 whole, it was most probable that 7042038757 silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his companion, had assisted 7042038757 woman to bear 7042038757 unconscious 7042362761 out 7042496517 7042038757 way 7042496517 danger.

"Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London, "it has been a pretty business for me! I 7042147896 lost my thumb 7042860694 I 7042147896 lost a fifty-guinea fee, 7042860694 what 7042147896 I gained?"

"Experience," said Holmes, laughing. "Indirectly it may be 7042496517 value, you 7042622762; you 7042147896 only to put it into words to gain 7042038757 reputation 7042496517 being excellent company for 7042038757 remainder 7042496517 your existence."

X.  7042038757 ADVENTURE 7042496517 7042038757 NOBLE BACHELOR


7042038757 Lord St. Simon marriage, 7042860694 its curious termination, 7042147896 long ceased to be a subject 7042496517 interest in those exalted circles in 7042545742 7042038757 unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals 7042147896 eclipsed it, 7042860694 their more piquant details 7042147896 drawn 7042038757 gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I 7042147896 reason to believe, however, that 7042038757 full facts 7042147896 never been revealed to 7042038757 general public, 7042860694 as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing 7042038757 matter up, I feel that no memoir 7042496517 him would be complete without some little sketch 7042496517 this remarkable episode.

It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during 7042038757 days when I was still sharing rooms 7042941055 Holmes in Baker Street, that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on 7042038757 table waiting for him. I had remained indoors 7042784042 day, for 7042038757 weather had taken a sudden turn to rain, 7042941055 high autumnal winds, 7042860694 7042038757 Jezail bullet 7042545742 I had brought back in one 7042496517 my limbs as a relic 7042496517 my Afghan campaign throbbed 7042941055 dull persistence. 7042941055 my body in one easy-chair 7042860694 my legs upon another, I had surrounded myself 7042941055 a cloud 7042496517 newspapers until at last, saturated 7042941055 7042038757 news 7042496517 7042038757 day, I tossed them 7042784042 aside 7042860694 lay listless, watching 7042038757 huge crest 7042860694 monogram upon 7042038757 envelope upon 7042038757 table 7042860694 wondering lazily who my friend's noble correspondent could be.

"Here is a very fashionable epistle," I remarked as he entered. "Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a fish-monger 7042860694 a tide-waiter."

"Yes, my correspondence has certainly 7042038757 charm 7042496517 variety," he answered, smiling, "7042860694 7042038757 humbler are usually 7042038757 more interesting. This looks like one 7042496517 those unwelcome social summonses 7042545742 call upon a 7042362761 either to be bored or to lie."

He broke 7042038757 seal 7042860694 glanced over 7042038757 contents.

"Oh, come, it may prove to be something 7042496517 interest, after 7042784042."

"Not social, then?"

"No, distinctly professional."

"7042860694 from a noble client?"

"One 7042496517 7042038757 highest in England."

"My dear fellow, I congratulate you."

"I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that 7042038757 status 7042496517 my client is a matter 7042496517 less moment to me than 7042038757 interest 7042496517 his case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation. You 7042147896 been reading 7042038757 papers diligently 7042496517 late, 7042147896 you not?"

"It looks like it," said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in 7042038757 corner. "I 7042147896 had nothing else to do."

"It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I read nothing except 7042038757 criminal news 7042860694 7042038757 agony column. 7042038757 latter is always instructive. But if you 7042147896 followed recent events so closely you must 7042147896 read about Lord St. Simon 7042860694 his wedding?"

"Oh, yes, 7042941055 7042038757 deepest interest."

"That is well. 7042038757 letter 7042545742 I hold in my hand is from Lord St. Simon. I will read it to you, 7042860694 in return you must turn over these papers 7042860694 let me 7042147896 whatever bears upon 7042038757 matter. This is what he says:

" 'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment 7042860694 discretion. I 7042147896 determined, therefore, to call upon you 7042860694 to consult you in reference to 7042038757 very painful event 7042545742 has occurred in connection 7042941055 my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, 7042496517 Scotland Yard, is acting already in 7042038757 matter, but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co-operation, 7042860694 that he even thinks that it might be 7042496517 some assistance. I will call at four o'clock in 7042038757 afternoon, 7042860694, should you 7042147896 any other engagement at that time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is 7042496517 paramount importance. Yours faithfully,


" 'ST. SIMON.'

"It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written 7042941055 a quill pen, 7042860694 7042038757 noble lord has had 7042038757 misfortune to get a smear 7042496517 ink upon 7042038757 outer side 7042496517 his right little finger," remarked Holmes as he folded up 7042038757 epistle.

"He says four o'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an hour."

"Then I 7042147896 just time, 7042941055 your assistance, to get clear upon 7042038757 subject. Turn over those papers 7042860694 arrange 7042038757 extracts in their order 7042496517 time, while I take a glance as to who our client is." He picked a red-covered volume from a line 7042496517 books 7042496517 reference beside 7042038757 mantelpiece. "Here he is," said he, sitting down 7042860694 flattening it out upon his knee. " 'Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St. Simon, second son 7042496517 7042038757 Duke 7042496517 Balmoral.' Hum! 'Arms: Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.' He's forty-one years 7042496517 age, 7042545742 is mature for marriage. Was Under-Secretary for 7042038757 colonies in a late administration. 7042038757 Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs. They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, 7042860694 Tudor on 7042038757 distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in 7042784042 this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something more solid."

"I 7042147896 very little difficulty in finding what I want," said I, "for 7042038757 facts are quite recent, 7042860694 7042038757 matter struck me as remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand 7042860694 that you disliked 7042038757 intrusion 7042496517 other matters."

"Oh, you mean 7042038757 little problem 7042496517 7042038757 Grosvenor Square furniture van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it was obvious from 7042038757 first. Pray give me 7042038757 results 7042496517 your newspaper selections."

"Here is 7042038757 first notice 7042545742 I can find. It is in 7042038757 personal column 7042496517 7042038757 Morning Post, 7042860694 dates, as you see, some weeks back: 'A marriage has been arranged,' it says, '7042860694 will, if rumour is correct, very shortly take place, 7042272895 Lord Robert St. Simon, second son 7042496517 7042038757 Duke 7042496517 Balmoral, 7042860694 Miss Hatty Doran, 7042038757 only daughter 7042496517 Aloysius Doran. Esq., 7042496517 San Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.' That is 7042784042."

"Terse 7042860694 to 7042038757 point," remarked Holmes, stretching his long, thin legs towards 7042038757 fire.

"There was a paragraph amplifying this in one 7042496517 7042038757 society papers 7042496517 7042038757 same week. Ah, here it is: 'There will soon be a call for protection in 7042038757 marriage market, for 7042038757 present free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. One by one 7042038757 management 7042496517 7042038757 noble houses 7042496517 Great Britain is passing into 7042038757 hands 7042496517 our fair cousins from across 7042038757 Atlantic. An important addition has been made during 7042038757 last week to 7042038757 list 7042496517 7042038757 prizes 7042545742 7042147896 been borne away by these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against 7042038757 little god's arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage 7042941055 Miss Hatty Doran, 7042038757 fascinating daughter 7042496517 a California millionaire. Miss Doran, whose graceful figure 7042860694 striking face attracted much attention at 7042038757 Westbury House festivities, is an only child, 7042860694 it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over 7042038757 six figures, 7042941055 expectancies for 7042038757 future. As it is an open secret that 7042038757 Duke 7042496517 Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within 7042038757 last few years, 7042860694 as Lord St. Simon has no property 7042496517 his own save 7042038757 small estate 7042496517 Birchmoor, it is obvious that 7042038757 Californian heiress is not 7042038757 only gainer by an alliance 7042545742 will enable her to make 7042038757 easy 7042860694 common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress.' "

"Anything else?" asked Holmes, yawning.

"Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in 7042038757 Morning Post to say that 7042038757 marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen intimate friends would be invited, 7042860694 that 7042038757 party would return to 7042038757 furnished house at Lancaster Gate 7042545742 has been taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that 7042038757 wedding had taken place, 7042860694 that 7042038757 honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater's place, near Petersfield. Those are 7042784042 7042038757 notices 7042545742 appeared before 7042038757 disappearance 7042496517 7042038757 bride."

"Before 7042038757 what?" asked Holmes 7042941055 a start.

"7042038757 vanishing 7042496517 7042038757 lady."

"When did she vanish, then?"

"At 7042038757 wedding breakfast."

"Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite dramatic, in fact."

"Yes; it struck me as being a little out 7042496517 7042038757 common."

"They often vanish before 7042038757 ceremony, 7042860694 occasionally during 7042038757 honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this. Pray let me 7042147896 7042038757 details."

"I warn you that they are very incomplete."

"Perhaps we may make them less so."

"Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article 7042496517 a morning paper 7042496517 yesterday, 7042545742 I will read to you. It is headed, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':

" '7042038757 family 7042496517 Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into 7042038757 greatest consternation by 7042038757 strange 7042860694 painful episodes 7042545742 7042147896 taken place in connection 7042941055 his wedding. 7042038757 ceremony, as shortly announced in 7042038757 papers 7042496517 yesterday, occurred on 7042038757 previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm 7042038757 strange rumours 7042545742 7042147896 been so persistently floating about. In spite 7042496517 7042038757 attempts 7042496517 7042038757 friends to hush 7042038757 matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.

" '7042038757 ceremony, 7042545742 was performed at St. George's, Hanover Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save 7042038757 father 7042496517 7042038757 bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, 7042038757 Duchess 7042496517 Balmoral, Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace 7042860694 Lady Clara St. Simon (7042038757 younger brother 7042860694 sister 7042496517 7042038757 bridegroom), 7042860694 Lady Alicia Whittington. 7042038757 whole party proceeded afterwards to 7042038757 house 7042496517 Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to force her way into 7042038757 house after 7042038757 bridal party, alleging that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a painful 7042860694 prolonged scene that she was ejected by 7042038757 butler 7042860694 7042038757 footman. 7042038757 bride, who had fortunately entered 7042038757 house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast 7042941055 7042038757 rest, when she complained 7042496517 a sudden indisposition 7042860694 retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster 7042860694 bonnet, 7042860694 hurried down to 7042038757 passage. One 7042496517 7042038757 footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave 7042038757 house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be 7042941055 7042038757 company. On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction 7042941055 7042038757 bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication 7042941055 7042038757 police, 7042860694 very energetic inquiries are being made, 7042545742 will probably result in a speedy clearing up 7042496517 this very singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to 7042038757 whereabouts 7042496517 7042038757 missing lady. There are rumours 7042496517 foul play in 7042038757 matter, 7042860694 it is said that 7042038757 police 7042147896 caused 7042038757 arrest 7042496517 7042038757 woman who had caused 7042038757 original disturbance, in 7042038757 belief that, from jealousy or some other motive, she may 7042147896 been concerned in 7042038757 strange disappearance 7042496517 7042038757 bride.' "

"7042860694 is that 7042784042?"

"Only one little item in another 7042496517 7042038757 morning papers, but it is a suggestive one."

"7042860694 it is--"

"That Miss Flora Millar, 7042038757 lady who had caused 7042038757 disturbance, has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at 7042038757 Allegro, 7042860694 that she has known 7042038757 bridegroom for some years. There are no further particulars, 7042860694 7042038757 whole case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in 7042038757 public press."

"7042860694 an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would not 7042147896 missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at 7042038757 bell, Watson, 7042860694 as 7042038757 clock makes it a few minutes after four, I 7042147896 no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not dream 7042496517 going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own memory."

"Lord Robert St. Simon," announced our page-boy, throwing open 7042038757 door. A gentleman entered, 7042941055 a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed 7042860694 pale, 7042941055 something perhaps 7042496517 petulance about 7042038757 mouth, 7042860694 7042941055 7042038757 steady, well-opened eye 7042496517 a 7042362761 whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command 7042860694 to be obeyed. His manner was brisk, 7042860694 yet his general appearance gave an undue impression 7042496517 age, for he had a slight forward stoop 7042860694 a little bend 7042496517 7042038757 knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round 7042038757 edges 7042860694 thin upon 7042038757 top. As to his dress, it was careful to 7042038757 verge 7042496517 foppishness, 7042941055 high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, 7042860694 light-coloured gaiters. He advanced slowly into 7042038757 room, turning his head from left to right, 7042860694 swinging in his right hand 7042038757 cord 7042545742 held his golden eyeglasses.

"Good-day, Lord St. Simon," said Holmes, rising 7042860694 bowing. "Pray take 7042038757 basket-chair. This is my friend 7042860694 colleague, Dr. Watson. Draw up a little to 7042038757 fire, 7042860694 we will talk this matter over."

"A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, Mr. Holmes. I 7042147896 been cut to 7042038757 quick. I understand that you 7042147896 already managed several delicate cases 7042496517 this sort, sir, though I presume that they were hardly from 7042038757 same class 7042496517 society."

"No, I am descending."

"I beg pardon."

"My last client 7042496517 7042038757 sort was a king."

"Oh, really! I had no idea. 7042860694 7042545742 king?"

"7042038757 King 7042496517 Scandinavia."

"What! Had he lost his wife?"

"You can understand," said Holmes suavely, "that I extend to 7042038757 affairs 7042496517 my other clients 7042038757 same secrecy 7042545742 I promise to you in yours."

"7042496517 course! Very right! very right! I'm sure I beg pardon. As to my own case, I am ready to give you any information 7042545742 may assist you in forming an opinion."

"Thank you. I 7042147896 already learned 7042784042 that is in 7042038757 public prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct--this article, for example, as to 7042038757 disappearance 7042496517 7042038757 bride."

Lord St. Simon glanced over it. "Yes, it is correct, as far as it goes."

"But it needs a great deal 7042496517 supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you."

"Pray do so."

"When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?"

"In San Francisco, a year ago."

"You were travelling in 7042038757 States?"

"Yes."

"Did you become engaged then?"

"No."

"But you were on a friendly footing?"

"I was amused by her society, 7042860694 she could see that I was amused."

"Her father is very rich?"

"He is said to be 7042038757 richest 7042362761 on 7042038757 Pacific slope."

"7042860694 how did he make his money?"

"In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold, invested it, 7042860694 came up by leaps 7042860694 bounds."

"Now, what is your own impression as to 7042038757 young lady's--your wife's character?"

7042038757 nobleman swung his glasses a little faster 7042860694 stared down into 7042038757 fire. "You see, Mr. Holmes," said he, "my wife was twenty before her father became a rich 7042362761. During that time she ran free in a mining camp 7042860694 wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than from 7042038757 schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy, 7042941055 a strong nature, wild 7042860694 free, unfettered by any sort 7042496517 traditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up her mind 7042860694 fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On 7042038757 other hand, I would not 7042147896 given her 7042038757 name 7042545742 I 7042147896 7042038757 honour to bear"--he gave a little stately cough--"had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable 7042496517 heroic self-sacrifice 7042860694 that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her."

"7042147896 you her photograph?"

"I brought this 7042941055 me." He opened a locket 7042860694 showed us 7042038757 full face 7042496517 a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature, 7042860694 7042038757 artist had brought out 7042038757 full effect 7042496517 7042038757 lustrous black hair, 7042038757 large dark eyes, 7042860694 7042038757 exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long 7042860694 earnestly at it. Then he closed 7042038757 locket 7042860694 handed it back to Lord St. Simon.

"7042038757 young lady came to London, then, 7042860694 you renewed your acquaintance?"

"Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I met her several times, became engaged to her, 7042860694 7042147896 now married her."

"She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?"

"A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family."

"7042860694 this, 7042496517 course, remains to you, since 7042038757 marriage is a fait accompli?"

"I really 7042147896 made no inquiries on 7042038757 subject."

"Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on 7042038757 day before 7042038757 wedding?"

"Yes."

"Was she in good spirits?"

"Never better. She kept talking 7042496517 what we should do in our future lives."

"Indeed! That is very interesting. 7042860694 on 7042038757 morning 7042496517 7042038757 wedding?"

"She was as bright as possible--at least until after 7042038757 ceremony."

"7042860694 did you observe any change in her then?"

"Well, to tell 7042038757 truth, I saw then 7042038757 first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. 7042038757 incident however, was too trivial to relate 7042860694 can 7042147896 no possible bearing upon 7042038757 case."

"Pray let us 7042147896 it, for 7042784042 that."

"Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards 7042038757 vestry. She was passing 7042038757 front pew at 7042038757 time, 7042860694 it fell over into 7042038757 pew. There was a moment's delay, but 7042038757 gentleman in 7042038757 pew handed it up to her again, 7042860694 it did not appear to be 7042038757 worse for 7042038757 fall. Yet when I spoke to her 7042496517 7042038757 matter, she answered me abruptly; 7042860694 in 7042038757 carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause."

"Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in 7042038757 pew. Some 7042496517 7042038757 general public were present, then?"

"Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when 7042038757 church is open."

"This gentleman was not one 7042496517 your wife's friends?"

"No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But really I think that we are wandering rather far from 7042038757 point."

"Lady St. Simon, then, returned from 7042038757 wedding in a less cheerful frame 7042496517 mind than she had gone to it. What did she do on re-entering her father's house?"

"I saw her in conversation 7042941055 her maid."

"7042860694 who is her maid?"

"Alice is her name. She is an American 7042860694 came from California 7042941055 her."

"A confidential servant?"

"A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties. Still, 7042496517 course, in America they look upon these things in a different way."

"How long did she speak to this Alice?"

"Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think 7042496517."

"You did not overhear what they said?"

"Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was accustomed to use slang 7042496517 7042038757 kind. I 7042147896 no idea what she meant."

"American slang is very expressive sometimes. 7042860694 what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?"

"She walked into 7042038757 breakfast-room."

"On your arm?"

"No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that. Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly, muttered some words 7042496517 apology, 7042860694 left 7042038757 room. She never came back."

"But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to her room, covered her bride's dress 7042941055 a long ulster, put on a bonnet, 7042860694 went out."

"Quite so. 7042860694 she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company 7042941055 Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, 7042860694 who had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that morning."

"Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady, 7042860694 your relations to her."

Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders 7042860694 raised his eyebrows. "We 7042147896 been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on a very friendly footing. She used to be at 7042038757 Allegro. I 7042147896 not treated her ungenerously, 7042860694 she had no just cause 7042496517 complaint against me, but you 7042622762 what women are, Mr. Holmes. Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed 7042860694 devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married, 7042860694, to tell 7042038757 truth, 7042038757 reason why I had 7042038757 marriage celebrated so quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in 7042038757 church. She came to Mr. Doran's door just after we returned, 7042860694 she endeavoured to push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, 7042860694 even threatening her, but I had foreseen 7042038757 possibility 7042496517 something 7042496517 7042038757 sort, 7042860694 I had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again. She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row."

"Did your wife hear 7042784042 this?"

"No, thank goodness, she did not."

"7042860694 she was seen walking 7042941055 this very woman afterwards?"

"Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, 7042496517 Scotland Yard, looks upon as so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out 7042860694 laid some terrible trap for her."

"Well, it is a possible supposition."

"You think so, too?"

"I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon this as likely?"

"I do not think Flora would hurt a fly."

"Still, jealousy is a strange transformer 7042496517 characters. Pray what is your own theory as to what took place?"

"Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I 7042147896 given you 7042784042 7042038757 facts. Since you ask me, however, I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that 7042038757 excitement 7042496517 this affair, 7042038757 consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had 7042038757 effect 7042496517 causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife."

"In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?"

"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I will not say upon me, but upon so much that many 7042147896 aspired to without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion."

"Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis," said Holmes, smiling. "7042860694 now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I 7042147896 nearly 7042784042 my data. May I ask whether you were seated at 7042038757 breakfast-table so that you could see out 7042496517 7042038757 window?"

"We could see 7042038757 other side 7042496517 7042038757 road 7042860694 7042038757 Park."

"Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer. I shall communicate 7042941055 you."

"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem," said our client, rising.

"I 7042147896 solved it."

"Eh? What was that?"

"I say that I 7042147896 solved it."

"Where, then, is my wife?"

"That is a detail 7042545742 I shall speedily supply."

Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine," he remarked, 7042860694 bowing in a stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.

"It is very good 7042496517 Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level 7042941055 his own," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "I think that I shall 7042147896 a whisky 7042860694 soda 7042860694 a cigar after 7042784042 this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to 7042038757 case before our client came into 7042038757 room."

"My dear Holmes!"

"I 7042147896 notes 7042496517 several similar cases, though none, as I remarked before, 7042545742 were quite as prompt. My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a trout in 7042038757 milk, to quote Thoreau's example."

"But I 7042147896 heard 7042784042 that you 7042147896 heard."

"Without, however, 7042038757 knowledge 7042496517 pre-existing cases 7042545742 serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, 7042860694 something on very much 7042038757 same lines at Munich 7042038757 year after 7042038757 Franco-Prussian War. It is one 7042496517 these cases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade! You will find an extra tumbler upon 7042038757 sideboard, 7042860694 there are cigars in 7042038757 box."

7042038757 official detective was attired in a pea-jacket 7042860694 cravat, 7042545742 gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, 7042860694 he carried a black canvas bag in his hand. 7042941055 a short greeting he seated himself 7042860694 lit 7042038757 cigar 7042545742 had been offered to him.

"What's up, then?" asked Holmes 7042941055 a twinkle in his eye. "You look dissatisfied."

"7042860694 I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage case. I can make neither head nor tail 7042496517 7042038757 business."

"Really! You surprise me."

"Who ever heard 7042496517 such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip through my fingers. I 7042147896 been at work upon it 7042784042 day."

"7042860694 very wet it seems to 7042147896 made you," said Holmes laying his hand upon 7042038757 arm 7042496517 7042038757 pea-jacket.

"Yes, I 7042147896 been dragging 7042038757 Serpentine."

"In heaven's name, what for?"

"In search 7042496517 7042038757 body 7042496517 Lady St. Simon."

Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair 7042860694 laughed heartily.

"7042147896 you dragged 7042038757 basin 7042496517 Trafalgar Square fountain?" he asked.

"Why? What do you mean?"

"Because you 7042147896 just as good a chance 7042496517 finding this lady in 7042038757 one as in 7042038757 other."

Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. "I suppose you 7042622762 7042784042 about it," he snarled.

"Well, I 7042147896 only just heard 7042038757 facts, but my mind is made up."

"Oh, indeed! Then you think that 7042038757 Serpentine plays no part in 7042038757 matter?"

"I think it very unlikely."

"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it?" He opened his bag as he spoke, 7042860694 tumbled onto 7042038757 floor a wedding-dress 7042496517 watered silk, a pair 7042496517 white satin shoes 7042860694 a bride's wreath 7042860694 veil, 7042784042 discoloured 7042860694 soaked in water. "There," said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon 7042038757 top 7042496517 7042038757 pile. "There is a little nut for you to crack, Master Holmes."

"Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue rings into 7042038757 air. "You dragged them from 7042038757 Serpentine?"

"No. They were found floating near 7042038757 margin by a park-keeper. They 7042147896 been identified as her clothes, 7042860694 it seemed to me that if 7042038757 clothes were there 7042038757 body would not be far off."

"By 7042038757 same brilliant reasoning, every 7042362761's body is to be found in 7042038757 neighbourhood 7042496517 his wardrobe. 7042860694 pray what did you hope to arrive at through this?"

"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in 7042038757 disappearance."

"I am afraid that you will find it difficult."

"Are you, indeed, now?" cried Lestrade 7042941055 some bitterness. "I am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical 7042941055 your deductions 7042860694 your inferences. You 7042147896 made two blunders in as many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar."

"7042860694 how?"

"In 7042038757 dress is a pocket. In 7042038757 pocket is a card-case. In 7042038757 card-case is a note. 7042860694 here is 7042038757 very note." He slapped it down upon 7042038757 table in front 7042496517 him. "Listen to this: 'You will see me when 7042784042 is ready. Come at once. F. H. M.' Now my theory 7042784042 along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar, 7042860694 that she, 7042941055 confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed 7042941055 her initials, is 7042038757 very note 7042545742 was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at 7042038757 door 7042860694 7042545742 lured her within their reach."

"Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing. "You really are very fine indeed. Let me see it." He took up 7042038757 paper in a listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, 7042860694 he gave a little cry 7042496517 satisfaction. "This is indeed important," said he.

"Ha! you find it so?"

"Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly."

Lestrade rose in his triumph 7042860694 bent his head to look. "Why," he shrieked, "you're looking at 7042038757 wrong side!"

"On 7042038757 contrary, this is 7042038757 right side."

"7042038757 right side? You're mad! Here is 7042038757 note written in pencil over here."

"7042860694 over here is what appears to be 7042038757 fragment 7042496517 a hotel bill, 7042545742 interests me deeply."

"There's nothing in it. I looked at it before," said Lestrade. " 'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s. 6d., glass sherry, 8d.' I see nothing in that."

"Very likely not. It is most important, 7042784042 7042038757 same. As to 7042038757 note, it is important also, or at least 7042038757 initials are, so I congratulate you again."

"I've wasted time enough," said Lestrade, rising. "I believe in hard work 7042860694 not in sitting by 7042038757 fire spinning fine theories. Good-day, Mr. Holmes, 7042860694 we shall see 7042545742 gets to 7042038757 bottom 7042496517 7042038757 matter first." He gathered up 7042038757 garments, thrust them into 7042038757 bag, 7042860694 made for 7042038757 door.

"Just one hint to you, Lestrade," drawled Holmes before his rival vanished; "I will tell you 7042038757 true solution 7042496517 7042038757 matter. Lady St. Simon is a myth. There is not, 7042860694 there never has been, any such person."

Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, 7042860694 hurried away.

He had hardly shut 7042038757 door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat. "There is something in what 7042038757 fellow says about outdoor work," he remarked, "so I think, Watson, that I must leave you to your papers for a little."

It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner's 7042362761 7042941055 a very large flat box. This he unpacked 7042941055 7042038757 help 7042496517 a youth whom he had brought 7042941055 him, 7042860694 presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple 7042496517 brace 7042496517 cold woodcock, a pheasant, a pate de foie gras pie 7042941055 a group 7042496517 ancient 7042860694 cobwebby bottles. Having laid out 7042784042 these luxuries, my two visitors vanished away, like 7042038757 genii 7042496517 7042038757 Arabian Nights, 7042941055 no explanation save that 7042038757 things had been paid for 7042860694 were ordered to this address.

Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into 7042038757 room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye 7042545742 made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.

"They 7042147896 laid 7042038757 supper, then," he said, rubbing his hands.

"You seem to expect company. They 7042147896 laid for five."

"Yes, I fancy we may 7042147896 some company dropping in," said he. "I am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I fancy that I hear his step now upon 7042038757 stairs."

It was indeed our visitor 7042496517 7042038757 afternoon who came bustling in, dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, 7042860694 7042941055 a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.

"My messenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes.

"Yes, 7042860694 I confess that 7042038757 contents startled me beyond measure. 7042147896 you good authority for what you say?"

"7042038757 best possible."

Lord St. Simon sank into a chair 7042860694 passed his hand over his forehead.

"What will 7042038757 Duke say," he murmured, "when he hears that one 7042496517 7042038757 family has been subjected to such humiliation?"

"It is 7042038757 purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any humiliation."

"Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint."

"I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how 7042038757 lady could 7042147896 acted otherwise, though her abrupt method 7042496517 doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she had no one to advise her at such a crisis."

"It was a slight, sir, a public slight," said Lord St. Simon, tapping his fingers upon 7042038757 table.

"You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented a position."

"I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, 7042860694 I 7042147896 been shamefully used."

"I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes. "Yes, there are steps on 7042038757 landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view 7042496517 7042038757 matter, Lord St. Simon, I 7042147896 brought an advocate here who may be more successful." He opened 7042038757 door 7042860694 ushered in a lady 7042860694 gentleman. "Lord St. Simon," said he "allow me to introduce you to Mr. 7042860694 Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. 7042038757 lady, I think, you 7042147896 already met."

At 7042038757 sight 7042496517 these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat 7042860694 stood very erect, 7042941055 his eyes cast down 7042860694 his hand thrust into 7042038757 breast 7042496517 his frock-coat, a picture 7042496517 offended dignity. 7042038757 lady had taken a quick step forward 7042860694 had held out her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was one 7042545742 it was hard to resist.

"You're angry, Robert," said she. "Well, I guess you 7042147896 every cause to be."

"Pray make no apology to me," said Lord St. Simon bitterly.

"Oh, yes, I 7042622762 that I 7042147896 treated you real bad 7042860694 that I should 7042147896 spoken to you before I went; but I was kind 7042496517 rattled, 7042860694 from 7042038757 time when I saw Frank here again I just didn't 7042622762 what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn't fall down 7042860694 do a faint right there before 7042038757 altar."

"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend 7042860694 me to leave 7042038757 room while you explain this matter?"

"If I may give an opinion," remarked 7042038757 strange gentleman, "we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business already. For my part, I should like 7042784042 Europe 7042860694 America to hear 7042038757 rights 7042496517 it." He was a small, wiry, sunburnt 7042362761, clean-shaven, 7042941055 a sharp face 7042860694 alert manner.

"Then I'll tell our story right away," said 7042038757 lady. "Frank here 7042860694 I met in '84, in McQuire's camp, near 7042038757 Rockies, where Pa was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank 7042860694 I; but then one day father struck a rich pocket 7042860694 made a pile, while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out 7042860694 came to nothing. 7042038757 richer Pa grew 7042038757 poorer was Frank; so at last Pa wouldn't hear 7042496517 our engagement lasting any longer, 7042860694 he took me away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so he followed me there, 7042860694 he saw me without Pa knowing anything about it. It would only 7042147896 made him mad to 7042622762, so we just fixed it 7042784042 up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go 7042860694 make his pile, too, 7042860694 never come back to claim me until he had as much as Pa. So then I promised to wait for him to 7042038757 end 7042496517 time 7042860694 pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. 'Why shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said he, '7042860694 then I will feel sure 7042496517 you; 7042860694 I won't claim to be your husband until I come back?' Well, we talked it over, 7042860694 he had fixed it 7042784042 up so nicely, 7042941055 a clergyman 7042784042 ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; 7042860694 then Frank went off to seek his fortune, 7042860694 I went back to Pa.

"7042038757 next I heard 7042496517 Frank was that he was in Montana, 7042860694 then he went prospecting in Arizona, 7042860694 then I heard 7042496517 him from New Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, 7042860694 there was my Frank's name among 7042038757 killed. I fainted dead away, 7042860694 I was very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline 7042860694 took me to half 7042038757 doctors in 'Frisco. Not a word 7042496517 news came for a year 7042860694 more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco, 7042860694 we came to London, 7042860694 a marriage was arranged, 7042860694 Pa was very pleased, but I felt 7042784042 7042038757 time that no 7042362761 on this earth would ever take 7042038757 place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.

"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, 7042496517 course I'd 7042147896 done my duty by him. We can't command our love, but we can our actions. I went to 7042038757 altar 7042941055 him 7042941055 7042038757 intention to make him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may imagine what I felt when, just as I came to 7042038757 altar rails, I glanced back 7042860694 saw Frank standing 7042860694 looking at me out 7042496517 7042038757 first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked again there he was still, 7042941055 a kind 7042496517 question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I didn't drop. I 7042622762 that everything was turning round, 7042860694 7042038757 words 7042496517 7042038757 clergyman were just like 7042038757 buzz 7042496517 a bee in my ear. I didn't 7042622762 what to do. Should I stop 7042038757 service 7042860694 make a scene in 7042038757 church? I glanced at him again, 7042860694 he seemed to 7042622762 what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece 7042496517 paper, 7042860694 I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on 7042038757 way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, 7042860694 he slipped 7042038757 note into my hand when he returned me 7042038757 flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he made 7042038757 sign to me to do so. 7042496517 course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, 7042860694 I determined to do just whatever he might direct.

"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California, 7042860694 had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed 7042860694 my ulster ready. I 7042622762 I ought to 7042147896 spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother 7042860694 7042784042 those great people. I just made up my mind to run away 7042860694 explain afterwards. I hadn't been at 7042038757 table ten minutes before I saw Frank out 7042496517 7042038757 window at 7042038757 other side 7042496517 7042038757 road. He beckoned to me 7042860694 then began walking into 7042038757 Park. I slipped out, put on my things, 7042860694 followed him. Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me--seemed to me from 7042038757 little I heard as if he had a little secret 7042496517 his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away from her 7042860694 soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, 7042860694 away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, 7042860694 that was my true wedding after 7042784042 those years 7042496517 waiting. Frank had been a prisoner among 7042038757 Apaches, had escaped, came on to 'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead 7042860694 had gone to England, followed me there, 7042860694 had come upon me at last on 7042038757 very morning 7042496517 my second wedding."

"I saw it in a paper," explained 7042038757 American. "It gave 7042038757 name 7042860694 7042038757 church but not where 7042038757 lady lived."

"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, 7042860694 Frank was 7042784042 for openness, but I was so ashamed 7042496517 it 7042784042 that I felt as if I should like to vanish away 7042860694 never see any 7042496517 them again--just sending a line to Pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It was awful to me to think 7042496517 7042784042 those lords 7042860694 ladies sitting round that breakfast-table 7042860694 waiting for me to come back. So Frank took my wedding-clothes 7042860694 things 7042860694 made a bundle 7042496517 them, so that I should not be traced, 7042860694 dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we should 7042147896 gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, 7042860694 he showed us very clearly 7042860694 kindly that I was wrong 7042860694 that Frank was right, 7042860694 that we should be putting ourselves in 7042038757 wrong if we were so secret. Then he offered to give us a chance 7042496517 talking to Lord St. Simon alone, 7042860694 so we came right away round to his rooms at once. Now, Robert, you 7042147896 heard it 7042784042, 7042860694 I am very sorry if I 7042147896 given you pain, 7042860694 I hope that you do not think very meanly 7042496517 me."

Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had listened 7042941055 a frowning brow 7042860694 a compressed lip to this long narrative.

"Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner."

"Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands before I go?"

"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure." He put out his hand 7042860694 coldly grasped that 7042545742 she extended to him.

"I had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you would 7042147896 joined us in a friendly supper."

"I think that there you ask a little too much," responded his Lordship. "I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them. I think that 7042941055 your permission I will now wish you 7042784042 a very good-night." He included us 7042784042 in a sweeping bow 7042860694 stalked out 7042496517 7042038757 room.

"Then I trust that you at least will honour me 7042941055 your company," said Sherlock Holmes. "It is always a joy to meet an American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one 7042496517 those who believe that 7042038757 folly 7042496517 a monarch 7042860694 7042038757 blundering 7042496517 a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens 7042496517 7042038757 same world-wide country under a flag 7042545742 shall be a quartering 7042496517 7042038757 Union Jack 7042941055 7042038757 Stars 7042860694 Stripes."

"7042038757 case has been an interesting one," remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us, "because it serves to show very clearly how simple 7042038757 explanation may be 7042496517 an affair 7042545742 at first sight seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural than 7042038757 sequence 7042496517 events as narrated by this lady, 7042860694 nothing stranger than 7042038757 result when viewed, for instance, by Mr. Lestrade 7042496517 Scotland Yard."

"You were not yourself at fault at 7042784042, then?"

"From 7042038757 first, two facts were very obvious to me, 7042038757 one that 7042038757 lady had been quite willing to undergo 7042038757 wedding ceremony, 7042038757 other that she had repented 7042496517 it within a few minutes 7042496517 returning home. Obviously something had occurred during 7042038757 morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that something be? She could not 7042147896 spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in 7042038757 company 7042496517 7042038757 bridegroom. Had she seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly 7042147896 allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that 7042038757 mere sight 7042496517 him would induce her to change her plans so completely. You see we 7042147896 already arrived, by a process 7042496517 exclusion, at 7042038757 idea that she might 7042147896 seen an American. Then who could this American be, 7042860694 why should he possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in rough scenes 7042860694 under strange conditions. So far I had got before I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative. When he told us 7042496517 a 7042362761 in a pew, 7042496517 7042038757 change in 7042038757 bride's manner, 7042496517 so transparent a device for obtaining a note as 7042038757 dropping 7042496517 a bouquet, 7042496517 her resort to her confidential maid, 7042860694 7042496517 her very significant allusion to claim-jumping--7042545742 in miners' parlance means taking possession 7042496517 that 7042545742 another person has a prior claim to--7042038757 whole situation became absolutely clear. She had gone off 7042941055 a 7042362761, 7042860694 7042038757 7042362761 was either a lover or was a previous husband--7042038757 chances being in favour 7042496517 7042038757 latter."

"7042860694 how in 7042038757 world did you find them?"

"It might 7042147896 been difficult, but friend Lestrade held information in his hands 7042038757 value 7042496517 7042545742 he did not himself 7042622762. 7042038757 initials were, 7042496517 course, 7042496517 7042038757 highest importance, but more valuable still was it to 7042622762 that within a week he had settled his bill at one 7042496517 7042038757 most select London hotels."

"How did you deduce 7042038757 select?"

"By 7042038757 select prices. Eight shillings for a bed 7042860694 eightpence for a glass 7042496517 sherry pointed to one 7042496517 7042038757 most expensive hotels. There are not many in London 7042545742 charge at that rate. In 7042038757 second one 7042545742 I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I learned by an inspection 7042496517 7042038757 book that Francis H. Moulton, an American gentleman, had left only 7042038757 day before, 7042860694 on looking over 7042038757 entries against him, I came upon 7042038757 very items 7042545742 I had seen in 7042038757 duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, 7042860694 being fortunate enough to find 7042038757 loving couple at home, I ventured to give them some paternal advice 7042860694 to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to 7042038757 general public 7042860694 to Lord St. Simon in particular. I invited them to meet him here, 7042860694, as you see, I made him keep 7042038757 appointment."

"But 7042941055 no very good result," I remarked. "His conduct was certainly not very gracious."

"Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps you would not be very gracious either, if, after 7042784042 7042038757 trouble 7042496517 wooing 7042860694 wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant 7042496517 wife 7042860694 7042496517 fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully 7042860694 thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in 7042038757 same position. Draw your chair up 7042860694 hand me my violin, for 7042038757 only problem we 7042147896 still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings."

XI.  7042038757 ADVENTURE 7042496517 7042038757 BERYL CORONET


"Holmes," said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking down 7042038757 street, "here is a madman coming along. It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone."

My friend rose lazily from his armchair 7042860694 stood 7042941055 his hands in 7042038757 pockets 7042496517 his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It was a bright, crisp February morning, 7042860694 7042038757 snow 7042496517 7042038757 day before still lay deep upon 7042038757 ground, shimmering brightly in 7042038757 wintry sun. Down 7042038757 centre 7042496517 Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by 7042038757 traffic, but at either side 7042860694 on 7042038757 heaped-up edges 7042496517 7042038757 foot-paths it still lay as white as when it fell. 7042038757 grey pavement had been cleaned 7042860694 scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer passengers than usual. Indeed, from 7042038757 direction 7042496517 7042038757 Metropolitan Station no one was coming save 7042038757 single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.

He was a 7042362761 7042496517 about fifty, tall, portly, 7042860694 imposing, 7042941055 a massive, strongly marked face 7042860694 a commanding figure. He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat brown gaiters, 7042860694 well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to 7042038757 dignity 7042496517 his dress 7042860694 features, for he was running hard, 7042941055 occasional little springs, such as a weary 7042362761 gives who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up 7042860694 down, waggled his head, 7042860694 writhed his face into 7042038757 most extraordinary contortions.

"What on earth can be 7042038757 matter 7042941055 him?" I asked. "He is looking up at 7042038757 numbers 7042496517 7042038757 houses."

"I believe that he is coming here," said Holmes, rubbing his hands.

"Here?"

"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I think that I recognise 7042038757 symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?" As he spoke, 7042038757 7042362761, puffing 7042860694 blowing, rushed at our door 7042860694 pulled at our bell until 7042038757 whole house resounded 7042941055 7042038757 clanging.

A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still gesticulating, but 7042941055 so fixed a look 7042496517 grief 7042860694 despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror 7042860694 pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body 7042860694 plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to 7042038757 extreme limits 7042496517 his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against 7042038757 wall 7042941055 such force that we both rushed upon him 7042860694 tore him away to 7042038757 centre 7042496517 7042038757 room. Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into 7042038757 easy-chair 7042860694, sitting beside him, patted his hand 7042860694 chatted 7042941055 him in 7042038757 easy, soothing tones 7042545742 he knew so well how to employ.

"You 7042147896 come to me to tell your story, 7042147896 you not?" said he. "You are fatigued 7042941055 your haste. Pray wait until you 7042147896 recovered yourself, 7042860694 then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem 7042545742 you may submit to me."

7042038757 7042362761 sat for a minute or more 7042941055 a heaving chest, fighting against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his lips tight, 7042860694 turned his face towards us.

"No doubt you think me mad?" said he.

"I see that you 7042147896 had some great trouble," responded Holmes.

"God knows I 7042147896!--a trouble 7042545742 is enough to unseat my reason, so sudden 7042860694 so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might 7042147896 faced, although I am a 7042362761 whose character has never yet borne a stain. Private affliction also is 7042038757 lot 7042496517 every 7042362761; but 7042038757 two coming together, 7042860694 in so frightful a form, 7042147896 been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone. 7042038757 very noblest in 7042038757 land may suffer unless some way be found out 7042496517 this horrible affair."

"Pray compose yourself, sir," said Holmes, "7042860694 let me 7042147896 a clear account 7042496517 who you are 7042860694 what it is that has befallen you."

"My name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your ears. I am Alexander Holder, 7042496517 7042038757 banking firm 7042496517 Holder & Stevenson, 7042496517 Threadneedle Street."

7042038757 name was indeed well known to us as belonging to 7042038757 senior partner in 7042038757 second largest private banking concern in 7042038757 City 7042496517 London. What could 7042147896 happened, then, to bring one 7042496517 7042038757 foremost citizens 7042496517 London to this most pitiable pass? We waited, 7042784042 curiosity, until 7042941055 another effort he braced himself to tell his story.

"I feel that time is 7042496517 value," said he; "that is why I hastened here when 7042038757 police inspector suggested that I should secure your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by 7042038757 Underground 7042860694 hurried from there on foot, for 7042038757 cabs go slowly through this snow. That is why I was so out 7042496517 breath, for I am a 7042362761 who takes very little exercise. I feel better now, 7042860694 I will put 7042038757 facts before you as shortly 7042860694 yet as clearly as I can.

"It is, 7042496517 course, well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection 7042860694 7042038757 number 7042496517 our depositors. One 7042496517 our most lucrative means 7042496517 laying out money is in 7042038757 shape 7042496517 loans, where 7042038757 security is unimpeachable. We 7042147896 done a good deal in this direction during 7042038757 last few years, 7042860694 there are many noble families to whom we 7042147896 advanced large sums upon 7042038757 security 7042496517 their pictures, libraries, or plate.

"Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at 7042038757 bank when a card was brought in to me by one 7042496517 7042038757 clerks. I started when I saw 7042038757 name, for it was that 7042496517 none other than--well, perhaps even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name 7042545742 is a household word 7042784042 over 7042038757 earth--one 7042496517 7042038757 highest, noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by 7042038757 honour 7042860694 attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business 7042941055 7042038757 air 7042496517 a 7042362761 who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.

" 'Mr. Holder,' said he, 'I 7042147896 been informed that you are in 7042038757 habit 7042496517 advancing money.'

" '7042038757 firm does so when 7042038757 security is good.' I answered.

" 'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should 7042147896 $50,000 at once. I could, 7042496517 course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it a matter 7042496517 business 7042860694 to carry out that business myself. In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one's self under obligations.'

" 'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?' I asked.

" 'Next Monday I 7042147896 a large sum due to me, 7042860694 I shall then most certainly repay what you advance, 7042941055 whatever interest you think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that 7042038757 money should be paid at once.'

" 'I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse,' said I, 'were it not that 7042038757 strain would be rather more than it could bear. If, on 7042038757 other hand, I am to do it in 7042038757 name 7042496517 7042038757 firm, then in justice to my partner I must insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.'

" 'I should much prefer to 7042147896 it so,' said he, raising up a square, black morocco case 7042545742 he had laid beside his chair. 'You 7042147896 doubtless heard 7042496517 7042038757 Beryl Coronet?'

" 'One 7042496517 7042038757 most precious public possessions 7042496517 7042038757 empire,' said I.

" 'Precisely.' He opened 7042038757 case, 7042860694 there, imbedded in soft, flesh-coloured velvet, lay 7042038757 magnificent piece 7042496517 jewellery 7042545742 he had named. 'There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,' said he, '7042860694 7042038757 price 7042496517 7042038757 gold chasing is incalculable. 7042038757 lowest estimate would put 7042038757 worth 7042496517 7042038757 coronet at double 7042038757 sum 7042545742 I 7042147896 asked. I am prepared to leave it 7042941055 you as my security.'

"I took 7042038757 precious case into my hands 7042860694 looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client.

" 'You doubt its value?' he asked.

" 'Not at 7042784042. I only doubt--'

" '7042038757 propriety 7042496517 my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest about that. I should not dream 7042496517 doing so were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a pure matter 7042496517 form. Is 7042038757 security sufficient?'

" 'Ample.'

" 'You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof 7042496517 7042038757 confidence 7042545742 I 7042147896 in you, founded upon 7042784042 that I 7042147896 heard 7042496517 you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet 7042860694 to refrain from 7042784042 gossip upon 7042038757 matter but, above 7042784042, to preserve this coronet 7042941055 every possible precaution because I need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in 7042038757 world to match these, 7042860694 it would be impossible to replace them. I leave it 7042941055 you, however, 7042941055 every confidence, 7042860694 I shall call for it in person on Monday morning.'

"Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but, calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty $1000 notes. When I was alone once more, however, 7042941055 7042038757 precious case lying upon 7042038757 table in front 7042496517 me, I could not but think 7042941055 some misgivings 7042496517 7042038757 immense responsibility 7042545742 it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever consented to take charge 7042496517 it. However, it was too late to alter 7042038757 matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe 7042860694 turned once more to my work.

"When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in 7042038757 office behind me. Bankers' safes had been forced before now, 7042860694 why should not mine be? If so, how terrible would be 7042038757 position in 7042545742 I should find myself! I determined, therefore, that for 7042038757 next few days I would always carry 7042038757 case backward 7042860694 forward 7042941055 me, so that it might never be really out 7042496517 my reach. 7042941055 this intention, I called a cab 7042860694 drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying 7042038757 jewel 7042941055 me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs 7042860694 locked it in 7042038757 bureau 7042496517 my dressing-room.

"7042860694 now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to thoroughly understand 7042038757 situation. My groom 7042860694 my page sleep out 7042496517 7042038757 house, 7042860694 may be set aside altogether. I 7042147896 three maid-servants who 7042147896 been 7042941055 me a number 7042496517 years 7042860694 whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy Parr, 7042038757 second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few months. She came 7042941055 an excellent character, however, 7042860694 has always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl 7042860694 has attracted admirers who 7042147896 occasionally hung about 7042038757 place. That is 7042038757 only drawback 7042545742 we 7042147896 found to her, but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.

"So much for 7042038757 servants. My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower 7042860694 7042147896 an only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr. Holmes--a grievous disappointment. I 7042147896 no doubt that I am myself to blame. People tell me that I 7042147896 spoiled him. Very likely I 7042147896. When my dear wife died I felt that he was 7042784042 I had to love. I could not bear to see 7042038757 smile fade even for a moment from his face. I 7042147896 never denied him a wish. Perhaps it would 7042147896 been better for both 7042496517 us had I been sterner, but I meant it for 7042038757 best.

"It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business, but he was not 7042496517 a business turn. He was wild, wayward, 7042860694, to speak 7042038757 truth, I could not trust him in 7042038757 handling 7042496517 large sums 7042496517 money. When he was young he became a member 7042496517 an aristocratic club, 7042860694 there, having charming manners, he was soon 7042038757 intimate 7042496517 a number 7042496517 men 7042941055 long purses 7042860694 expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards 7042860694 to squander money on 7042038757 turf, until he had again 7042860694 again to come to me 7042860694 implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance, that he might settle his debts 7042496517 honour. He tried more than once to break away from 7042038757 dangerous company 7042545742 he was keeping, but each time 7042038757 influence 7042496517 his friend, Sir George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.

"7042860694, indeed, I could not wonder that such a 7042362761 as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to my house, 7042860694 I 7042147896 found myself that I could hardly resist 7042038757 fascination 7042496517 his manner. He is older than Arthur, a 7042362761 7042496517 7042038757 world to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, 7042860694 a 7042362761 7042496517 great personal beauty. Yet when I think 7042496517 him in cold blood, far away from 7042038757 glamour 7042496517 his presence, I am convinced from his cynical speech 7042860694 7042038757 look 7042545742 I 7042147896 caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, 7042860694 so, too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman's quick insight into character.

"7042860694 now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but when my brother died five years ago 7042860694 left her alone in 7042038757 world I adopted her, 7042860694 7042147896 looked upon her ever since as my daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager 7042860694 housekeeper, yet as tender 7042860694 quiet 7042860694 gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not 7042622762 what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I think that if anyone could 7042147896 drawn him into 7042038757 right path it would 7042147896 been she, 7042860694 that his marriage might 7042147896 changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!

"Now, Mr. Holmes, you 7042622762 7042038757 people who live under my roof, 7042860694 I shall continue 7042941055 my miserable story.

"When we were taking coffee in 7042038757 drawing-room that night after dinner, I told Arthur 7042860694 Mary my experience, 7042860694 7042496517 7042038757 precious treasure 7042545742 we had under our roof, suppressing only 7042038757 name 7042496517 my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in 7042038757 coffee, had, I am sure, left 7042038757 room; but I cannot swear that 7042038757 door was closed. Mary 7042860694 Arthur were much interested 7042860694 wished to see 7042038757 famous coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.

" 'Where 7042147896 you put it?' asked Arthur.

" 'In my own bureau.'

" 'Well, I hope to goodness 7042038757 house won't be burgled during 7042038757 night.' said he.

" 'It is locked up,' I answered.

" 'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I 7042147896 opened it myself 7042941055 7042038757 key 7042496517 7042038757 box-room cupboard.'

"He often had a wild way 7042496517 talking, so that I thought little 7042496517 what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night 7042941055 a very grave face.

" 'Look here, dad,' said he 7042941055 his eyes cast down, 'can you let me 7042147896 $200?'

" 'No, I cannot!' I answered sharply. 'I 7042147896 been far too generous 7042941055 you in money matters.'

" 'You 7042147896 been very kind,' said he, 'but I must 7042147896 this money, or else I can never show my face inside 7042038757 club again.'

" '7042860694 a very good thing, too!' I cried.

" 'Yes, but you would not 7042147896 me leave it a dishonoured 7042362761,' said he. 'I could not bear 7042038757 disgrace. I must raise 7042038757 money in some way, 7042860694 if you will not let me 7042147896 it, then I must try other means.'

"I was very angry, for this was 7042038757 third demand during 7042038757 month. 'You shall not 7042147896 a farthing from me,' I cried, on 7042545742 he bowed 7042860694 left 7042038757 room without another word.

"When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was safe, 7042860694 locked it again. Then I started to go round 7042038757 house to see that 7042784042 was secure--a duty 7042545742 I usually leave to Mary but 7042545742 I thought it well to perform myself that night. As I came down 7042038757 stairs I saw Mary herself at 7042038757 side window 7042496517 7042038757 hall, 7042545742 she closed 7042860694 fastened as I approached.

" 'Tell me, dad,' said she, looking, I thought, a little disturbed, 'did you give Lucy, 7042038757 maid, leave to go out to-night?'

" 'Certainly not.'

" 'She came in just now by 7042038757 back door. I 7042147896 no doubt that she has only been to 7042038757 side gate to see someone, but I think that it is hardly safe 7042860694 should be stopped.'

" 'You must speak to her in 7042038757 morning, or I will if you prefer it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?'

" 'Quite sure, dad.'

" 'Then, good-night.' I kissed her 7042860694 went up to my bedroom again, where I was soon asleep.

"I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, 7042545742 may 7042147896 any bearing upon 7042038757 case, but I beg that you will question me upon any point 7042545742 I do not make clear."

"On 7042038757 contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."

"I come to a part 7042496517 my story now in 7042545742 I should wish to be particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, 7042860694 7042038757 anxiety in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. About two in 7042038757 morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in 7042038757 house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere. I lay listening 7042941055 7042784042 my ears. Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound 7042496517 footsteps moving softly in 7042038757 next room. I slipped out 7042496517 bed, 7042784042 palpitating 7042941055 fear, 7042860694 peeped round 7042038757 corner 7042496517 my dressing-room door.

" 'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dare you touch that coronet?'

"7042038757 gas was half up, as I had left it, 7042860694 my unhappy boy, dressed only in his shirt 7042860694 trousers, was standing beside 7042038757 light, holding 7042038757 coronet in his hands. He appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending it 7042941055 7042784042 his strength. At my cry he dropped it from his grasp 7042860694 turned as pale as death. I snatched it up 7042860694 examined it. One 7042496517 7042038757 gold corners, 7042941055 three 7042496517 7042038757 beryls in it, was missing.

" 'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself 7042941055 rage. 'You 7042147896 destroyed it! You 7042147896 dishonoured me forever! Where are 7042038757 jewels 7042545742 you 7042147896 stolen?'

" 'Stolen!' he cried.

" 'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by 7042038757 shoulder.

" 'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.

" 'There are three missing. 7042860694 you 7042622762 where they are. Must I call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece?'

" 'You 7042147896 called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it any longer. I shall not say another word about this business, since you 7042147896 chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in 7042038757 morning 7042860694 make my own way in 7042038757 world.'

" 'You shall leave it in 7042038757 hands 7042496517 7042038757 police!' I cried half-mad 7042941055 grief 7042860694 rage. 'I shall 7042147896 this matter probed to 7042038757 bottom.'

" 'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he 7042941055 a passion such as I should not 7042147896 thought was in his nature. 'If you choose to call 7042038757 police, let 7042038757 police find what they can.'

"By this time 7042038757 whole house was astir, for I had raised my voice in my anger. Mary was 7042038757 first to rush into my room, 7042860694, at 7042038757 sight 7042496517 7042038757 coronet 7042860694 7042496517 Arthur's face, she read 7042038757 whole story 7042860694, 7042941055 a scream, fell down senseless on 7042038757 ground. I sent 7042038757 house-maid for 7042038757 police 7042860694 put 7042038757 investigation into their hands at once. When 7042038757 inspector 7042860694 a constable entered 7042038757 house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly 7042941055 his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge him 7042941055 theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private matter, but had become a public one, since 7042038757 ruined coronet was national property. I was determined that 7042038757 law should 7042147896 its way in everything.

" 'At least,' said he, 'you will not 7042147896 me arrested at once. It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave 7042038757 house for five minutes.'

" 'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you 7042147896 stolen,' said I. 7042860694 then, realising 7042038757 dreadful position in 7042545742 I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that 7042496517 one who was far greater than I was at stake; 7042860694 that he threatened to raise a scandal 7042545742 would convulse 7042038757 nation. He might avert it 7042784042 if he would but tell me what he had done 7042941055 7042038757 three missing stones.

" 'You may as well face 7042038757 matter,' said I; 'you 7042147896 been caught in 7042038757 act, 7042860694 no confession could make your guilt more heinous. If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where 7042038757 beryls are, 7042784042 shall be forgiven 7042860694 forgotten.'

" 'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered, turning away from me 7042941055 a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened for any words 7042496517 mine to influence him. There was but one way for it. I called in 7042038757 inspector 7042860694 gave him into custody. A search was made at once not only 7042496517 his person but 7042496517 his room 7042860694 7042496517 every portion 7042496517 7042038757 house where he could possibly 7042147896 concealed 7042038757 gems; but no trace 7042496517 them could be found, nor would 7042038757 wretched boy open his mouth for 7042784042 our persuasions 7042860694 our threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, 7042860694 I, after going through 7042784042 7042038757 police formalities, 7042147896 hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling 7042038757 matter. 7042038757 police 7042147896 openly confessed that they can at present make nothing 7042496517 it. You may go to any expense 7042545742 you think necessary. I 7042147896 already offered a reward 7042496517 $1000. My God, what shall I do! I 7042147896 lost my honour, my gems, 7042860694 my son in one night. Oh, what shall I do!"

He put a hand on either side 7042496517 his head 7042860694 rocked himself to 7042860694 fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.

Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, 7042941055 his brows knitted 7042860694 his eyes fixed upon 7042038757 fire.

"Do you receive much company?" he asked.

"None save my partner 7042941055 his family 7042860694 an occasional friend 7042496517 Arthur's. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No one else, I think."

"Do you go out much in society?"

"Arthur does. Mary 7042860694 I stay at home. We neither 7042496517 us care for it."

"That is unusual in a young girl."

"She is 7042496517 a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She is four-7042860694-twenty."

"This matter, from what you say, seems to 7042147896 been a shock to her also."

"Terrible! She is even more affected than I."

"You 7042147896 neither 7042496517 you any doubt as to your son's guilt?"

"How can we 7042147896 when I saw him 7042941055 my own eyes 7042941055 7042038757 coronet in his hands."

"I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was 7042038757 remainder 7042496517 7042038757 coronet at 7042784042 injured?"

"Yes, it was twisted."

"Do you not think, then, that he might 7042147896 been trying to straighten it?"

"God bless you! You are doing what you can for him 7042860694 for me. But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at 7042784042? If his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?"

"Precisely. 7042860694 if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several singular points about 7042038757 case. What did 7042038757 police think 7042496517 7042038757 noise 7042545742 awoke you from your sleep?"

"They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's closing his bedroom door."

"A likely story! As if a 7042362761 bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, 7042496517 7042038757 disappearance 7042496517 these gems?"

"They are still sounding 7042038757 planking 7042860694 probing 7042038757 furniture in 7042038757 hope 7042496517 finding them."

"7042147896 they thought 7042496517 looking outside 7042038757 house?"

"Yes, they 7042147896 shown extraordinary energy. 7042038757 whole garden has already been minutely examined."

"Now, my dear sir," said Holmes. "is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or 7042038757 police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion 7042496517 it, went off to some other place, concealed three gems out 7042496517 7042038757 thirty-nine, 7042941055 such skill that nobody can find them, 7042860694 then returned 7042941055 7042038757 other thirty-six into 7042038757 room in 7042545742 he exposed himself to 7042038757 greatest danger 7042496517 being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?"

"But what other is there?" cried 7042038757 banker 7042941055 a gesture 7042496517 despair. "If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?"

"It is our task to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now, if you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together, 7042860694 devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details."

My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, 7042545742 I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity 7042860694 sympathy were deeply stirred by 7042038757 story to 7042545742 we had listened. I confess that 7042038757 guilt 7042496517 7042038757 banker's son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes' judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied 7042941055 7042038757 accepted explanation. He hardly spoke a word 7042038757 whole way out to 7042038757 southern suburb, but sat 7042941055 his chin upon his breast 7042860694 his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in 7042038757 deepest thought. Our client appeared to 7042147896 taken fresh heart at 7042038757 little glimpse 7042496517 hope 7042545742 had been presented to him, 7042860694 he even broke into a desultory chat 7042941055 me over his business affairs. A short railway journey 7042860694 a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, 7042038757 modest residence 7042496517 7042038757 great financier.

Fairbank was a good-sized square house 7042496517 white stone, standing back a little from 7042038757 road. A double carriage-sweep, 7042941055 a snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates 7042545742 closed 7042038757 entrance. On 7042038757 right side was a small wooden thicket, 7042545742 led into a narrow path 7042272895 two neat hedges stretching from 7042038757 road to 7042038757 kitchen door, 7042860694 forming 7042038757 tradesmen's entrance. On 7042038757 left ran a lane 7042545742 led to 7042038757 stables, 7042860694 was not itself within 7042038757 grounds at 7042784042, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing at 7042038757 door 7042860694 walked slowly 7042784042 round 7042038757 house, across 7042038757 front, down 7042038757 tradesmen's path, 7042860694 so round by 7042038757 garden behind into 7042038757 stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder 7042860694 I went into 7042038757 dining-room 7042860694 waited by 7042038757 fire until he should return. We were sitting there in silence when 7042038757 door opened 7042860694 a young lady came in. She was rather above 7042038757 middle height, slim, 7042941055 dark hair 7042860694 eyes, 7042545742 seemed 7042038757 darker against 7042038757 absolute pallor 7042496517 her skin. I do not think that I 7042147896 ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. Her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed 7042941055 crying. As she swept silently into 7042038757 room she impressed me 7042941055 a greater sense 7042496517 grief than 7042038757 banker had done in 7042038757 morning, 7042860694 it was 7042038757 more striking in her as she was evidently a woman 7042496517 strong character, 7042941055 immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding my presence, she went straight to her uncle 7042860694 passed her hand over his head 7042941055 a sweet womanly caress.

"You 7042147896 given orders that Arthur should be liberated, 7042147896 you not, dad?" she asked.

"No, no, my girl, 7042038757 matter must be probed to 7042038757 bottom."

"But I am so sure that he is innocent. You 7042622762 what woman's instincts are. I 7042622762 that he has done no harm 7042860694 that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly."

"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"

"Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him."

"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him 7042941055 7042038757 coronet in his hand?"

"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take my word for it that he is innocent. Let 7042038757 matter drop 7042860694 say no more. It is so dreadful to think 7042496517 our dear Arthur in prison!"

"I shall never let it drop until 7042038757 gems are found--never, Mary! Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to 7042038757 awful consequences to me. Far from hushing 7042038757 thing up, I 7042147896 brought a gentleman down from London to inquire more deeply into it."

"This gentleman?" she asked, facing round to me.

"No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in 7042038757 stable lane now."

"7042038757 stable lane?" She raised her dark eyebrows. "What can he hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir, that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is 7042038757 truth, that my cousin Arthur is innocent 7042496517 this crime."

"I fully share your opinion, 7042860694 I trust, 7042941055 you, that we may prove it," returned Holmes, going back to 7042038757 mat to knock 7042038757 snow from his shoes. "I believe I 7042147896 7042038757 honour 7042496517 addressing Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?"

"Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up."

"You heard nothing yourself last night?"

"Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard that, 7042860694 I came down."

"You shut up 7042038757 windows 7042860694 doors 7042038757 night before. Did you fasten 7042784042 7042038757 windows?"

"Yes."

"Were they 7042784042 fastened this morning?"

"Yes."

"You 7042147896 a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?"

"Yes, 7042860694 she was 7042038757 girl who waited in 7042038757 drawing-room, 7042860694 who may 7042147896 heard uncle's remarks about 7042038757 coronet."

"I see. You infer that she may 7042147896 gone out to tell her sweetheart, 7042860694 that 7042038757 two may 7042147896 planned 7042038757 robbery."

"But what is 7042038757 good 7042496517 7042784042 these vague theories," cried 7042038757 banker impatiently, "when I 7042147896 told you that I saw Arthur 7042941055 7042038757 coronet in his hands?"

"Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by 7042038757 kitchen door, I presume?"

"Yes; when I went to see if 7042038757 door was fastened for 7042038757 night I met her slipping in. I saw 7042038757 7042362761, too, in 7042038757 gloom."

"Do you 7042622762 him?"

"Oh, yes! he is 7042038757 green-grocer who brings our vegetables round. His name is Francis Prosper."

"He stood," said Holmes, "to 7042038757 left 7042496517 7042038757 door--that is to say, farther up 7042038757 path than is necessary to reach 7042038757 door?"

"Yes, he did."

"7042860694 he is a 7042362761 7042941055 a wooden leg?"

Something like fear sprang up in 7042038757 young lady's expressive black eyes. "Why, you are like a magician," said she. "How do you 7042622762 that?" She smiled, but there was no answering smile in Holmes' thin, eager face.

"I should be very glad now to go upstairs," said he. "I shall probably wish to go over 7042038757 outside 7042496517 7042038757 house again. Perhaps I had better take a look at 7042038757 lower windows before I go up."

He walked swiftly round from one to 7042038757 other, pausing only at 7042038757 large one 7042545742 looked from 7042038757 hall onto 7042038757 stable lane. This he opened 7042860694 made a very careful examination 7042496517 7042038757 sill 7042941055 his powerful magnifying lens. "Now we shall go upstairs," said he at last.

7042038757 banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, 7042941055 a grey carpet, a large bureau, 7042860694 a long mirror. Holmes went to 7042038757 bureau first 7042860694 looked hard at 7042038757 lock.

"7042545742 key was used to open it?" he asked.

"That 7042545742 my son himself indicated--that 7042496517 7042038757 cupboard 7042496517 7042038757 lumber-room."

"7042147896 you it here?"

"That is it on 7042038757 dressing-table."

Sherlock Holmes took it up 7042860694 opened 7042038757 bureau.

"It is a noiseless lock," said he. "It is no wonder that it did not wake you. This case, I presume, contains 7042038757 coronet. We must 7042147896 a look at it." He opened 7042038757 case, 7042860694 taking out 7042038757 diadem he laid it upon 7042038757 table. It was a magnificent specimen 7042496517 7042038757 jeweller's art, 7042860694 7042038757 thirty-six stones were 7042038757 finest that I 7042147896 ever seen. At one side 7042496517 7042038757 coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.

"Now, Mr. Holder," said Holmes, "here is 7042038757 corner 7042545742 corresponds to that 7042545742 has been so unfortunately lost. Might I beg that you will break it off."

7042038757 banker recoiled in horror. "I should not dream 7042496517 trying," said he.

"Then I will." Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without result. "I feel it give a little," said he; "but, though I am exceptionally strong in 7042038757 fingers, it would take me 7042784042 my time to break it. An ordinary 7042362761 could not do it. Now, what do you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that 7042784042 this happened within a few yards 7042496517 your bed 7042860694 that you heard nothing 7042496517 it?"

"I do not 7042622762 what to think. It is 7042784042 dark to me."

"But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think, Miss Holder?"

"I confess that I still share my uncle's perplexity."

"Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?"

"He had nothing on save only his trousers 7042860694 shirt."

"Thank you. We 7042147896 certainly been favoured 7042941055 extraordinary luck during this inquiry, 7042860694 it will be entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing 7042038757 matter up. 7042941055 your permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations outside."

He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an hour or more he was at work, returning at last 7042941055 his feet heavy 7042941055 snow 7042860694 his features as inscrutable as ever.

"I think that I 7042147896 seen now 7042784042 that there is to see, Mr. Holder," said he; "I can serve you best by returning to my rooms."

"But 7042038757 gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?"

"I cannot tell."

7042038757 banker wrung his hands. "I shall never see them again!" he cried. "7042860694 my son? You give me hopes?"

"My opinion is in no way altered."

"Then, for God's sake, what was this dark business 7042545742 was acted in my house last night?"

"If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow morning 7042272895 nine 7042860694 ten I shall be happy to do what I can to make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you, provided only that I get back 7042038757 gems, 7042860694 that you place no limit on 7042038757 sum I may draw."

"I would give my fortune to 7042147896 them back."

"Very good. I shall look into 7042038757 matter 7042272895 this 7042860694 then. Good-bye; it is just possible that I may 7042147896 to come over here again before evening."

It was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up about 7042038757 case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon 7042038757 point, but he always glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber 7042860694 was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. 7042941055 his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, 7042860694 his worn boots, he was a perfect sample 7042496517 7042038757 class.

"I think that this should do," said he, glancing into 7042038757 glass above 7042038757 fireplace. "I only wish that you could come 7042941055 me, Watson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on 7042038757 trail in this matter, or I may be following a will-o'-7042038757-wisp, but I shall soon 7042622762 7042545742 it is. I hope that I may be back in a few hours." He cut a slice 7042496517 beef from 7042038757 joint upon 7042038757 sideboard, sandwiched it 7042272895 two rounds 7042496517 bread, 7042860694 thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.

I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. He chucked it down into a corner 7042860694 helped himself to a cup 7042496517 tea.

"I only looked in as I passed," said he. "I am going right on."

"Where to?"

"Oh, to 7042038757 other side 7042496517 7042038757 West End. It may be some time before I get back. Don't wait up for me in case I should be late."

"How are you getting on?"

"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain 7042496517. I 7042147896 been out to Streatham since I saw you last, but I did not call at 7042038757 house. It is a very sweet little problem, 7042860694 I would not 7042147896 missed it for a good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable clothes off 7042860694 return to my highly respectable self."

I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled, 7042860694 there was even a touch 7042496517 colour upon his sallow cheeks. He hastened upstairs, 7042860694 a few minutes later I heard 7042038757 slam 7042496517 7042038757 hall door, 7042545742 told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.

I waited until midnight, but there was no sign 7042496517 his return, so I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days 7042860694 nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not 7042622762 at what hour he came in, but when I came down to breakfast in 7042038757 morning there he was 7042941055 a cup 7042496517 coffee in one hand 7042860694 7042038757 paper in 7042038757 other, as fresh 7042860694 trim as possible.

"You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson," said he, "but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning."

"Why, it is after nine now," I answered. "I should not be surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring."

It was, indeed, our friend 7042038757 financier. I was shocked by 7042038757 change 7042545742 had come over him, for his face 7042545742 was naturally 7042496517 a broad 7042860694 massive mould, was now pinched 7042860694 fallen in, while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered 7042941055 a weariness 7042860694 lethargy 7042545742 was even more painful than his violence 7042496517 7042038757 morning before, 7042860694 he dropped heavily into 7042038757 armchair 7042545742 I pushed forward for him.

"I do not 7042622762 what I 7042147896 done to be so severely tried," said he. "Only two days ago I was a happy 7042860694 prosperous 7042362761, without a care in 7042038757 world. Now I am left to a lonely 7042860694 dishonoured age. One sorrow comes close upon 7042038757 heels 7042496517 another. My niece, Mary, has deserted me."

"Deserted you?"

"Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty, 7042860694 a note for me lay upon 7042038757 hall table. I had said to her last night, in sorrow 7042860694 not in anger, that if she had married my boy 7042784042 might 7042147896 been well 7042941055 him. Perhaps it was thoughtless 7042496517 me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers in this note:

" 'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I 7042147896 brought trouble upon you, 7042860694 that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never 7042147896 occurred. I cannot, 7042941055 this thought in my mind, ever again be happy under your roof, 7042860694 I feel that I must leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is provided for; 7042860694, above 7042784042, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless labour 7042860694 an ill-service to me. In life or in death, I am ever your loving


" 'MARY.'

"What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it points to suicide?"

"No, no, nothing 7042496517 7042038757 kind. It is perhaps 7042038757 best possible solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing 7042038757 end 7042496517 your troubles."

"Ha! You say so! You 7042147896 heard something, Mr. Holmes; you 7042147896 learned something! Where are 7042038757 gems?"

"You would not think $1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?"

"I would pay ten."

"That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover 7042038757 matter. 7042860694 there is a little reward, I fancy. 7042147896 you your check-book? Here is a pen. Better make it out for $4000."

7042941055 a dazed face 7042038757 banker made out 7042038757 required check. Holmes walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece 7042496517 gold 7042941055 three gems in it, 7042860694 threw it down upon 7042038757 table.

7042941055 a shriek 7042496517 joy our client clutched it up.

"You 7042147896 it!" he gasped. "I am saved! I am saved!"

7042038757 reaction 7042496517 joy was as passionate as his grief had been, 7042860694 he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.

"There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder," said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly.

"Owe!" He caught up a pen. "Name 7042038757 sum, 7042860694 I will pay it."

"No, 7042038757 debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to 7042147896 one."

"Then it was not Arthur who took them?"

"I told you yesterday, 7042860694 I repeat to-day, that it was not."

"You are sure 7042496517 it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him 7042622762 that 7042038757 truth is known."

"He knows it already. When I had cleared it 7042784042 up I had an interview 7042941055 him, 7042860694 finding that he would not tell me 7042038757 story, I told it to him, on 7042545742 he had to confess that I was right 7042860694 to add 7042038757 very few details 7042545742 were not yet quite clear to me. Your news 7042496517 this morning, however, may open his lips."

"For heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!"

"I will do so, 7042860694 I will show you 7042038757 steps by 7042545742 I reached it. 7042860694 let me say to you, first, that 7042545742 it is hardest for me to say 7042860694 for you to hear: there has been an understanding 7042272895 Sir George Burnwell 7042860694 your niece Mary. They 7042147896 now fled together."

"My Mary? Impossible!"

"It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither you nor your son knew 7042038757 true character 7042496517 this 7042362761 when you admitted him into your family circle. He is one 7042496517 7042038757 most dangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a 7042362761 without heart or conscience. Your niece knew nothing 7042496517 such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she alone had touched his heart. 7042038757 devil knows best what he said, but at least she became his tool 7042860694 was in 7042038757 habit 7042496517 seeing him nearly every evening."

"I cannot, 7042860694 I will not, believe it!" cried 7042038757 banker 7042941055 an ashen face.

"I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down 7042860694 talked to her lover through 7042038757 window 7042545742 leads into 7042038757 stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right through 7042038757 snow, so long had he stood there. She told him 7042496517 7042038757 coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at 7042038757 news, 7042860694 he bent her to his will. I 7042147896 no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom 7042038757 love 7042496517 a lover extinguishes 7042784042 other loves, 7042860694 I think that she must 7042147896 been one. She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs, on 7042545742 she closed 7042038757 window rapidly 7042860694 told you about one 7042496517 7042038757 servants' escapade 7042941055 her wooden-legged lover, 7042545742 was 7042784042 perfectly true.

"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview 7042941055 you but he slept badly on account 7042496517 his uneasiness about his club debts. In 7042038757 middle 7042496517 7042038757 night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose 7042860694, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along 7042038757 passage until she disappeared into your dressing-room. Petrified 7042941055 astonishment, 7042038757 lad slipped on some clothes 7042860694 waited there in 7042038757 dark to see what would come 7042496517 this strange affair. Presently she emerged from 7042038757 room again, 7042860694 in 7042038757 light 7042496517 7042038757 passage-lamp your son saw that she carried 7042038757 precious coronet in her hands. She passed down 7042038757 stairs, 7042860694 he, thrilling 7042941055 horror, ran along 7042860694 slipped behind 7042038757 curtain near your door, whence he could see what passed in 7042038757 hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open 7042038757 window, hand out 7042038757 coronet to someone in 7042038757 gloom, 7042860694 then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close to where he stood hid behind 7042038757 curtain.

"As long as she was on 7042038757 scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure 7042496517 7042038757 woman whom he loved. But 7042038757 instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you, 7042860694 how 7042784042-important it was to set it right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened 7042038757 window, sprang out into 7042038757 snow, 7042860694 ran down 7042038757 lane, where he could see a dark figure in 7042038757 moonlight. Sir George Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, 7042860694 there was a struggle 7042272895 them, your lad tugging at one side 7042496517 7042038757 coronet, 7042860694 his opponent at 7042038757 other. In 7042038757 scuffle, your son struck Sir George 7042860694 cut him over 7042038757 eye. Then something suddenly snapped, 7042860694 your son, finding that he had 7042038757 coronet in his hands, rushed back, closed 7042038757 window, ascended to your room, 7042860694 had just observed that 7042038757 coronet had been twisted in 7042038757 struggle 7042860694 was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon 7042038757 scene."

"Is it possible?" gasped 7042038757 banker.

"You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not explain 7042038757 true state 7042496517 affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He took 7042038757 more chivalrous view, however, 7042860694 preserved her secret."

"7042860694 that was why she shrieked 7042860694 fainted when she saw 7042038757 coronet," cried Mr. Holder. "Oh, my God! what a blind fool I 7042147896 been! 7042860694 his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! 7042038757 dear fellow wanted to see if 7042038757 missing piece were at 7042038757 scene 7042496517 7042038757 struggle. How cruelly I 7042147896 misjudged him!"

"When I arrived at 7042038757 house," continued Holmes, "I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in 7042038757 snow 7042545742 might help me. I knew that none had fallen since 7042038757 evening before, 7042860694 also that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions. I passed along 7042038757 tradesmen's path, but found it 7042784042 trampled down 7042860694 indistinguishable. Just beyond it, however, at 7042038757 far side 7042496517 7042038757 kitchen door, a woman had stood 7042860694 talked 7042941055 a 7042362761, whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been disturbed, for 7042038757 woman had run back swiftly to 7042038757 door, as was shown by 7042038757 deep toe 7042860694 light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had waited a little, 7042860694 then had gone away. I thought at 7042038757 time that this might be 7042038757 maid 7042860694 her sweetheart, 7042496517 whom you had already spoken to me, 7042860694 inquiry showed it was so. I passed round 7042038757 garden without seeing anything more than random tracks, 7042545742 I took to be 7042038757 police; but when I got into 7042038757 stable lane a very long 7042860694 complex story was written in 7042038757 snow in front 7042496517 me.

"There was a double line 7042496517 tracks 7042496517 a booted 7042362761, 7042860694 a second double line 7042545742 I saw 7042941055 delight belonged to a 7042362761 7042941055 naked feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that 7042038757 latter was your son. 7042038757 first had walked both ways, but 7042038757 other had run swiftly, 7042860694 as his tread was marked in places over 7042038757 depression 7042496517 7042038757 boot, it was obvious that he had passed after 7042038757 other. I followed them up 7042860694 found they led to 7042038757 hall window, where Boots had worn 7042784042 7042038757 snow away while waiting. Then I walked to 7042038757 other end, 7042545742 was a hundred yards or more down 7042038757 lane. I saw where Boots had faced round, where 7042038757 snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, 7042860694, finally, where a few drops 7042496517 blood had fallen, to show me that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down 7042038757 lane, 7042860694 another little smudge 7042496517 blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. When he came to 7042038757 highroad at 7042038757 other end, I found that 7042038757 pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.

"On entering 7042038757 house, however, I examined, as you remember, 7042038757 sill 7042860694 framework 7042496517 7042038757 hall window 7042941055 my lens, 7042860694 I could at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish 7042038757 outline 7042496517 an instep where 7042038757 wet foot had been placed in coming in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. A 7042362761 had waited outside 7042038757 window; someone had brought 7042038757 gems; 7042038757 deed had been overseen by your son; he had pursued 7042038757 thief; had struggled 7042941055 him; they had each tugged at 7042038757 coronet, their united strength causing injuries 7042545742 neither alone could 7042147896 effected. He had returned 7042941055 7042038757 prize, but had left a fragment in 7042038757 grasp 7042496517 his opponent. So far I was clear. 7042038757 question now was, who was 7042038757 7042362761 7042860694 who was it brought him 7042038757 coronet?

"It is an old maxim 7042496517 mine that when you 7042147896 excluded 7042038757 impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be 7042038757 truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained your niece 7042860694 7042038757 maids. But if it were 7042038757 maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret--7042038757 more so as 7042038757 secret was a disgraceful one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, 7042860694 how she had fainted on seeing 7042038757 coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty.

"7042860694 who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently, for who else could outweigh 7042038757 love 7042860694 gratitude 7042545742 she must feel to you? I knew that you went out little, 7042860694 that your circle 7042496517 friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir George Burnwell. I had heard 7042496517 him before as being a 7042362761 7042496517 evil reputation among women. It must 7042147896 been he who wore those boots 7042860694 retained 7042038757 missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was safe, for 7042038757 lad could not say a word without compromising his own family.

"Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next. I went in 7042038757 shape 7042496517 a loafer to Sir George's house, managed to pick up an acquaintance 7042941055 his valet, learned that his master had cut his head 7042038757 night before, 7042860694, finally, at 7042038757 expense 7042496517 six shillings, made 7042784042 sure by buying a pair 7042496517 his cast-off shoes. 7042941055 these I journeyed down to Streatham 7042860694 saw that they exactly fitted 7042038757 tracks."

"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in 7042038757 lane yesterday evening," said Mr. Holder.

"Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my 7042362761, so I came home 7042860694 changed my clothes. It was a delicate part 7042545742 I had to play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, 7042860694 I knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in 7042038757 matter. I went 7042860694 saw him. At first, 7042496517 course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster 7042860694 took down a life-preserver from 7042038757 wall. I knew my 7042362761, however, 7042860694 I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give him a price for 7042038757 stones he held--$1000 apiece. That brought out 7042038757 first signs 7042496517 grief that he had shown. 'Why, dash it 7042784042!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for 7042038757 three!' I soon managed to get 7042038757 address 7042496517 7042038757 receiver who had them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I set to him, 7042860694 after much chaffering I got our stones at $1000 apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that 7042784042 was right, 7042860694 eventually got to my bed about two o'clock, after what I may call a really hard day's work."

"A day 7042545742 has saved England from a great public scandal," said 7042038757 banker, rising. "Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you 7042147896 done. Your skill has indeed exceeded 7042784042 that I 7042147896 heard 7042496517 it. 7042860694 now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for 7042038757 wrong 7042545742 I 7042147896 done him. As to what you tell me 7042496517 poor Mary, it goes to my very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now."

"I think that we may safely say," returned Holmes, "that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment."

XII.  7042038757 ADVENTURE 7042496517 7042038757 COPPER BEECHES


"To 7042038757 7042362761 who loves art for its own sake," remarked Sherlock Holmes, tossing aside 7042038757 advertisement sheet 7042496517 7042038757 Daily Telegraph, "it is frequently in its least important 7042860694 lowliest manifestations that 7042038757 keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you 7042147896 so far grasped this truth that in these little records 7042496517 our cases 7042545742 you 7042147896 been good enough to draw up, 7042860694, I am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you 7042147896 given prominence not so much to 7042038757 many causes celebres 7042860694 sensational trials in 7042545742 I 7042147896 figured but rather to those incidents 7042545742 may 7042147896 been trivial in themselves, but 7042545742 7042147896 given room for those faculties 7042496517 deduction 7042860694 7042496517 logical synthesis 7042545742 I 7042147896 made my special province."

"7042860694 yet," said I, smiling, "I cannot quite hold myself absolved from 7042038757 charge 7042496517 sensationalism 7042545742 has been urged against my records."

"You 7042147896 erred, perhaps," he observed, taking up a glowing cinder 7042941055 7042038757 tongs 7042860694 lighting 7042941055 it 7042038757 long cherry-wood pipe 7042545742 was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood--"you 7042147896 erred perhaps in attempting to put colour 7042860694 life into each 7042496517 your statements instead 7042496517 confining yourself to 7042038757 task 7042496517 placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect 7042545742 is really 7042038757 only notable feature about 7042038757 thing."

"It seems to me that I 7042147896 done you full justice in 7042038757 matter," I remarked 7042941055 some coldness, for I was repelled by 7042038757 egotism 7042545742 I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend's singular character.

"No, it is not selfishness or conceit," said he, answering, as was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. "If I claim full justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon 7042038757 logic rather than upon 7042038757 crime that you should dwell. You 7042147896 degraded what should 7042147896 been a course 7042496517 lectures into a series 7042496517 tales."

It was a cold morning 7042496517 7042038757 early spring, 7042860694 we sat after breakfast on either side 7042496517 a cheery fire in 7042038757 old room at Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down 7042272895 7042038757 lines 7042496517 dun-coloured houses, 7042860694 7042038757 opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through 7042038757 heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit 7042860694 shone on 7042038757 white cloth 7042860694 glimmer 7042496517 china 7042860694 metal, for 7042038757 table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been silent 7042784042 7042038757 morning, dipping continuously into 7042038757 advertisement columns 7042496517 a succession 7042496517 papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.

"At 7042038757 same time," he remarked after a pause, during 7042545742 he had sat puffing at his long pipe 7042860694 gazing down into 7042038757 fire, "you can hardly be open to a charge 7042496517 sensationalism, for out 7042496517 these cases 7042545742 you 7042147896 been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat 7042496517 crime, in its legal sense, at 7042784042. 7042038757 small matter in 7042545742 I endeavoured to help 7042038757 King 7042496517 Bohemia, 7042038757 singular experience 7042496517 Miss Mary Sutherland, 7042038757 problem connected 7042941055 7042038757 7042362761 7042941055 7042038757 twisted lip, 7042860694 7042038757 incident 7042496517 7042038757 noble bachelor, were 7042784042 matters 7042545742 are outside 7042038757 pale 7042496517 7042038757 law. But in avoiding 7042038757 sensational, I fear that you may 7042147896 bordered on 7042038757 trivial."

"7042038757 end may 7042147896 been so," I answered, "but 7042038757 methods I hold to 7042147896 been novel 7042860694 7042496517 interest."

"Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do 7042038757 public, 7042038757 great unobservant public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb, care about 7042038757 finer shades 7042496517 analysis 7042860694 deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial. I cannot blame you, for 7042038757 days 7042496517 7042038757 great cases are past. 7042362761, or at least criminal 7042362761, has lost 7042784042 enterprise 7042860694 originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils 7042860694 giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I 7042147896 touched bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my zero-point, I fancy. Read it!" He tossed a crumpled letter across to me.

It was dated from Montague Place upon 7042038757 preceding evening, 7042860694 ran thus:

"DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation 7042545742 has been offered to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,


"VIOLET HUNTER."

"Do you 7042622762 7042038757 young lady?" I asked.

"Not I."

"It is half-past ten now."

"Yes, 7042860694 I 7042147896 no doubt that is her ring."

"It may turn out to be 7042496517 more interest than you think. You remember that 7042038757 affair 7042496517 7042038757 blue carbuncle, 7042545742 appeared to be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation. It may be so in this case, also."

"Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved, for here, unless I am much mistaken, is 7042038757 person in question."

As he spoke 7042038757 door opened 7042860694 a young lady entered 7042038757 room. She was plainly but neatly dressed, 7042941055 a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover's egg, 7042860694 7042941055 7042038757 brisk manner 7042496517 a woman who has had her own way to make in 7042038757 world.

"You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure," said she, as my companion rose to greet her, "but I 7042147896 had a very strange experience, 7042860694 as I 7042147896 no parents or relations 7042496517 any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do."

"Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you."

I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by 7042038757 manner 7042860694 speech 7042496517 his new client. He looked her over in his searching fashion, 7042860694 then composed himself, 7042941055 his lids drooping 7042860694 his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.

"I 7042147896 been a governess for five years," said she, "in 7042038757 family 7042496517 Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago 7042038757 colonel received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, 7042860694 took his children over to America 7042941055 him, so that I found myself without a situation. I advertised, 7042860694 I answered advertisements, but without success. At last 7042038757 little money 7042545742 I had saved began to run short, 7042860694 I was at my wit's end as to what I should do.

"There is a well-known agency for governesses in 7042038757 West End called Westaway's, 7042860694 there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up 7042545742 might suit me. Westaway was 7042038757 name 7042496517 7042038757 founder 7042496517 7042038757 business, but it is really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office, 7042860694 7042038757 ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom, 7042860694 are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers 7042860694 sees whether she has anything 7042545742 would suit them.

"Well, when I called last week I was shown into 7042038757 little office as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A prodigiously stout 7042362761 7042941055 a very smiling face 7042860694 a great heavy chin 7042545742 rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow 7042941055 a pair 7042496517 glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at 7042038757 ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair 7042860694 turned quickly to Miss Stoper.

" 'That will do,' said he; 'I could not ask for anything better. Capital! capital!' He seemed quite enthusiastic 7042860694 rubbed his hands together in 7042038757 most genial fashion. He was such a comfortable-looking 7042362761 that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.

" 'You are looking for a situation, miss?' he asked.

" 'Yes, sir.'

" 'As governess?'

" 'Yes, sir.'

" '7042860694 what salary do you ask?'

" 'I had $4 a month in my last place 7042941055 Colonel Spence Munro.'

" 'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!' he cried, throwing his fat hands out into 7042038757 air like a 7042362761 who is in a boiling passion. 'How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady 7042941055 such attractions 7042860694 accomplishments?'

" 'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,' said I. 'A little French, a little German, music, 7042860694 drawing--'

" 'Tut, tut!' he cried. 'This is 7042784042 quite beside 7042038757 question. 7042038757 point is, 7042147896 you or 7042147896 you not 7042038757 bearing 7042860694 deportment 7042496517 a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you 7042147896 not, you are not fitted for 7042038757 rearing 7042496517 a child who may some day play a considerable part in 7042038757 history 7042496517 7042038757 country. But if you 7042147896 why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under 7042038757 three figures? Your salary 7042941055 me, madam, would commence at $100 a year.'

"You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. 7042038757 gentleman, however, seeing perhaps 7042038757 look 7042496517 incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book 7042860694 took out a note.

" 'It is also my custom,' said he, smiling in 7042038757 most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid 7042038757 white creases 7042496517 his face, 'to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses 7042496517 their journey 7042860694 their wardrobe.'

"It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating 7042860694 so thoughtful a 7042362761. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, 7042038757 advance was a great convenience, 7042860694 yet there was something unnatural about 7042038757 whole transaction 7042545742 made me wish to 7042622762 a little more before I quite committed myself.

" 'May I ask where you live, sir?' said I.

" 'Hampshire. Charming rural place. 7042038757 Copper Beeches, five miles on 7042038757 far side 7042496517 Winchester. It is 7042038757 most lovely country, my dear young lady, 7042860694 7042038757 dearest old country-house.'

" '7042860694 my duties, sir? I should be glad to 7042622762 what they would be.'

" 'One child--one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if you could see him killing cockroaches 7042941055 a slipper! Smack! smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!' He leaned back in his chair 7042860694 laughed his eyes into his head again.

"I was a little startled at 7042038757 nature 7042496517 7042038757 child's amusement, but 7042038757 father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.

" 'My sole duties, then,' I asked, 'are to take charge 7042496517 a single child?'

" 'No, no, not 7042038757 sole, not 7042038757 sole, my dear young lady,' he cried. 'Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they were such commands as a lady might 7042941055 propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?'

" 'I should be happy to make myself useful.'

" 'Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you 7042622762--faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress 7042545742 we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. Heh?'

" 'No,' said I, considerably astonished at his words.

" 'Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?'

" 'Oh, no.'

" 'Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?'

"I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes, my hair is somewhat luxuriant, 7042860694 7042496517 a rather peculiar tint 7042496517 chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream 7042496517 sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.

" 'I am afraid that that is quite impossible,' said I. He had been watching me eagerly out 7042496517 his small eyes, 7042860694 I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke.

" 'I am afraid that it is quite essential,' said he. 'It is a little fancy 7042496517 my wife's, 7042860694 ladies' fancies, you 7042622762, madam, ladies' fancies must be consulted. 7042860694 so you won't cut your hair?'

" 'No, sir, I really could not,' I answered firmly.

" 'Ah, very well; then that quite settles 7042038757 matter. It is a pity, because in other respects you would really 7042147896 done very nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more 7042496517 your young ladies.'

"7042038757 manageress had sat 7042784042 this while busy 7042941055 her papers without a word to either 7042496517 us, but she glanced at me now 7042941055 so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.

" 'Do you desire your name to be kept upon 7042038757 books?' she asked.

" 'If you please, Miss Stoper.'

" 'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse 7042038757 most excellent offers in this fashion,' said she sharply. 'You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.' She struck a gong upon 7042038757 table, 7042860694 I was shown out by 7042038757 page.

"Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings 7042860694 found little enough in 7042038757 cupboard, 7042860694 two or three bills upon 7042038757 table. I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing. After 7042784042, if these people had strange fads 7042860694 expected obedience on 7042038757 most extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few governesses in England are getting $100 a year. Besides, what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing it short 7042860694 perhaps I should be among 7042038757 number. Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake, 7042860694 by 7042038757 day after I was sure 7042496517 it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to 7042038757 agency 7042860694 inquire whether 7042038757 place was still open when I received this letter from 7042038757 gentleman himself. I 7042147896 it here 7042860694 I will read it to you:


" '7042038757 Copper Beeches, near Winchester.

" 'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address, 7042860694 I write from here to ask you whether you 7042147896 reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you should come, for she has been much attracted by my description 7042496517 you. We are willing to give $30 a quarter, or $120 a year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience 7042545742 our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after 7042784042. My wife is fond 7042496517 a particular shade 7042496517 electric blue 7042860694 would like you to wear such a dress indoors in 7042038757 morning. You need not, however, go to 7042038757 expense 7042496517 purchasing one, as we 7042147896 one belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), 7042545742 would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point, 7042860694 I only hope that 7042038757 increased salary may recompense you for 7042038757 loss. Your duties, as far as 7042038757 child is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, 7042860694 I shall meet you 7042941055 7042038757 dog-cart at Winchester. Let me 7042622762 your train. Yours faithfully,


" 'JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'

"That is 7042038757 letter 7042545742 I 7042147896 just received, Mr. Holmes, 7042860694 my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however, that before taking 7042038757 final step I should like to submit 7042038757 whole matter to your consideration."

"Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles 7042038757 question," said Holmes, smiling.

"But you would not advise me to refuse?"

"I confess that it is not 7042038757 situation 7042545742 I should like to see a sister 7042496517 mine apply for."

"What is 7042038757 meaning 7042496517 it 7042784042, Mr. Holmes?"

"Ah, I 7042147896 no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you 7042147896 yourself formed some opinion?"

"Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr. Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured 7042362761. Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep 7042038757 matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, 7042860694 that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak?"

"That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is 7042038757 most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a nice household for a young lady."

"But 7042038757 money, Mr. Holmes, 7042038757 money!"

"Well, yes, 7042496517 course 7042038757 pay is good--too good. That is what makes me uneasy. Why should they give you $120 a year, when they could 7042147896 their pick for $40? There must be some strong reason behind."

"I thought that if I told you 7042038757 circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at 7042038757 back 7042496517 me."

"Oh, you may carry that feeling away 7042941055 you. I assure you that your little problem promises to be 7042038757 most interesting 7042545742 has come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel about some 7042496517 7042038757 features. If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger--"

"Danger! What danger do you foresee?"

Holmes shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be a danger if we could define it," said he. "But at any time, day or night, a telegram would bring me down to your help."

"That is enough." She rose briskly from her chair 7042941055 7042038757 anxiety 7042784042 swept from her face. "I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair to-night, 7042860694 start for Winchester to-morrow." 7042941055 a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good-night 7042860694 bustled off upon her way.

"At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending 7042038757 stairs, "she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care 7042496517 herself."

"7042860694 she would need to be," said Holmes gravely. "I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past."

It was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled. A fortnight went by, during 7042545742 I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction 7042860694 wondering what strange side-alley 7042496517 human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. 7042038757 unusual salary, 7042038757 curious conditions, 7042038757 light duties, 7042784042 pointed to something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether 7042038757 7042362761 were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end, 7042941055 knitted brows 7042860694 an abstracted air, but he swept 7042038757 matter away 7042941055 a wave 7042496517 his hand when I mentioned it. "Data! data! data!" he cried impatiently. "I can't make bricks without clay." 7042860694 yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister 7042496517 his should ever 7042147896 accepted such a situation.

7042038757 telegram 7042545742 we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking 7042496517 turning in 7042860694 Holmes was settling down to one 7042496517 those 7042784042-night chemical researches 7042545742 he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort 7042860694 a test-tube at night 7042860694 find him in 7042038757 same position when I came down to breakfast in 7042038757 morning. He opened 7042038757 yellow envelope, 7042860694 then, glancing at 7042038757 message, threw it across to me.

"Just look up 7042038757 trains in Bradshaw," said he, 7042860694 turned back to his chemical studies.

7042038757 summons was a brief 7042860694 urgent one.

"Please be at 7042038757 Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to-morrow," it said. "Do come! I am at my wit's end.


"HUNTER."

"Will you come 7042941055 me?" asked Holmes, glancing up.

"I should wish to."

"Just look it up, then."

"There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my Bradshaw. "It is due at Winchester at 11:30."

"That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis 7042496517 7042038757 acetones, as we may need to be at our best in 7042038757 morning."

By eleven o'clock 7042038757 next day we were well upon our way to 7042038757 old English capital. Holmes had been buried in 7042038757 morning papers 7042784042 7042038757 way down, but after we had passed 7042038757 Hampshire border he threw them down 7042860694 began to admire 7042038757 scenery. It was an ideal spring day, a light blue sky, flecked 7042941055 little fleecy white clouds drifting across from west to east. 7042038757 sun was shining very brightly, 7042860694 yet there was an exhilarating nip in 7042038757 air, 7042545742 set an edge to a 7042362761's energy. 7042784042 over 7042038757 countryside, away to 7042038757 rolling hills around Aldershot, 7042038757 little red 7042860694 grey roofs 7042496517 7042038757 farm-steadings peeped out from amid 7042038757 light green 7042496517 7042038757 new foliage.

"Are they not fresh 7042860694 beautiful?" I cried 7042941055 7042784042 7042038757 enthusiasm 7042496517 a 7042362761 fresh from 7042038757 fogs 7042496517 Baker Street.

But Holmes shook his head gravely.

"Do you 7042622762, Watson," said he, "that it is one 7042496517 7042038757 curses 7042496517 a mind 7042941055 a turn like mine that I must look at everything 7042941055 reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, 7042860694 you are impressed
